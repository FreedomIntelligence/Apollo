["Giant posterior fossa arachnoid cyst causing tonsillar herniation and cervical syringomyelia: This was a case report of a 28-year-old female patient presented with a history of paraesthesia involving right upper limb of 8 months duration. She had a spontaneous abortion 3 weeks ago. Following that, she developed sudden onset of weakness of both lower limbs (left side greater than the right side). There was a history of headache on and off increased by coughing. Her bowel and bladder functions were normal and also general and systemic examination was normal. Cranial nerves were normal. Fundus examination was normal. She had a weakness of all four limbs (lower limbs more than upper limbs). Deep tendon reflexes were exaggerated in lower limbs and sluggish in upper limbs. Planters were extensors. There was also dissociated sensory loss on her right arm and shoulder. Patient was investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain and cervical spine and it showed giant retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst extending into the left cerebellopontine angle causing descent of the cerebellar tonsils across the foramen magnum with a syringomyelic cavity extending from C1 down and associated ventriculomegaly []. The patient underwent midline suboccipital craniectomy, foramen magnum decompression and C1 arch excision with duroplasty. Part of the cyst wall was excised. Histopathological examination of the cyst wall showed a cuboidal layer of arachnoid cells suggestive of arachnoid cyst []. Follow-up images showed a reduction in the size of the cyst and reduction in the mass effect over cerebellum and brain stem structures []. At 10 months follow-up, patient made an uneventful recovery and doing well."]
["Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma of the Hand with Lung Metastases: A 92-year-old, right-handed male presented to the oncology department with a three-month history of a rapidly enlarging, painless mass on the dorsum of his left hand. He had a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cerebral vascular disease. On examination of the hand, there was a 7 cm x 6 cm soft, non-tender, and immobile mass on the lateral aspect of the left hand, with no tethering to the overlying skin. There was a full range of movement of his wrist joint and fingers, and there were no neurological deficits. Repeat examination a few months later revealed that the mass had increased in size, ulcerated, and began to bleed (Figure ).\\nAn initial ultrasound scan demonstrated a large mass arising from the radial wrist, measuring approximately 6.4 cm x 5.3 cm x 2.7 cm. Before a biopsy was attempted, a computed tomography (CT) angiogram was performed to rule out any aneurysm within the mass. This demonstrated that the mass had increased in size (diameter of 8.5 cm) after two months. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of the hand mass was performed: this displayed moderately pleomorphic epithelioid spindle cells within a myxoid stroma containing thin-walled and compressed vessels. These features were suggestive of a spindle cell sarcoma.\\nA CT scan performed two months later demonstrated a mass lesion measuring 12.5 cm x 8 cm x 6 cm, centered around the level of the radiocarpal joint and enveloped the radial artery. A staging CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a single 4-mm nodule in the upper lobe of the right lung. This was thought to be a simple nodule, and, therefore, a surveillance CT scan of the chest was booked to take place in four months.\\nBecause of extreme pain and bleeding from the tumor, neoadjuvant radiotherapy was given to reduce tumor size and relieve pain. However, despite the radiotherapy, there was no appreciable improvement in size or symptoms. After extensive multidisciplinary team discussions, a left above-the-elbow amputation with wide safety margins was performed to provide the patient with a better quality of life. Histopathology examination of the post-surgical specimen illustrated ovoid-spindle cells and pleomorphic tumor cells with no definite line of differentiation (mitotic count more than 20 per 10 high-power fields in some areas). The immunohistochemical examination demonstrated negative staining for S-100 and CD34, scanty staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and patchy positive staining for desmin. These features confirmed a high-grade (grade 3) UPS (Figure ).\\nSeven months later, the patient presented to the emergency department with a productive cough and confusion. A chest X-ray revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary metastases (Figure ). In view of these findings, a palliative approach was deemed appropriate and a referral was made to the Macmillan Cancer Support Team."]

["A single bolus of high dose levothyroxine (L-T4) as a test in cases of suspected poor compliance to L-T4 therapy: Twenty-one year old female (weight about 55 kg, BMI 21.2 kg/m2) presented with very high TSH (198.76 μIU/ml during hospital admission, previous TSH in the outpatient setting 378 μIU/ml) despite taking 175 μg of L-T4. Problems with adequate control dated back about 6 years with massive swings in TSH concentrations (e.g. TSH 92.58 μIU/ml and 23.3 on 200 μg of L-T4, and 2 years later TSH 0.062 μIU/ml on 150 μg of L-T4). Dilution test (Table ) showed no evidence of interference, with similar post-dilution recovery concentrations. Levothyroxine (1000 μg) was administered with quick reduction of TSH and evidence of good absorption of L-T4 (a rise in FT4 from 1.13 ng/dl to 2.72 ng/dl within 10 h) -Table . She eventually admitted to missing occasional tablets and more often to taking L-T4 with or even after breakfast with morning coffee. About 2 months post discharge she presented with suppressed TSH.

["Management of Pulmonary Hemorrhage Complicating Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy: A 71-year-old man with a history of chronic lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary emboli, and pulmonary hypertension on home oxygen and Ventavis® (iloprost) presented for PTE. During the rewarming period after PTE, bright red blood was noted in the endotracheal tube. A bronchoscope was used to suction 750 ml of blood from the airway. After an unsuccessful attempt to place a left sided Arndt endobronchial blocker (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN,USA) with a standard adult bronchoscope the decision was made to attempt to exchange the single lumen 8 mm endotracheal tube (ETT) to a 41F left sided double lumen tube (DLT). The initial DLT exchange over a tube exchanger was unsuccessful. The patient was extubated and a DLT 41F left sided tube was placed under direct visual laryngoscopy and position confirmed with a 5.2 mm distal tip diameter bronchoscope. Approximately 1L of blood was suctioned from the left endobronchial lumen. Single right lung ventilation was initiated and separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was successful. Prior to transfer to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit (CSICU), the left lung bleeding slowed and two-lung ventilation was initiated. Respiratory failure in the post-operative period resulted in a need for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO). The bleeding stopped overnight and the DLT was exchanged for a standard ETT. The patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. Comfort measures only were initiated, and the patient expired on postoperative day (POD) 9."]

Other symptoms include postprandial pelvic and abdominal pain, nausea, urgency, incontinence, nocturnal seepage, and weight loss of 15 pounds over the past 2 months. He was an active smoker. The patient washed had been diagnosed with having pouchitis and enteritis on pouchoscopy and histology. His past treatment regimen included metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, oral and topical mesalamines, hydrocortisone enemas, and oral prednisone with minimal relief of symptoms. He was on long-term oral budesonide with recurrent symptoms while tapering off the corticosteroid. He underwent multiple pouchoscopies that showed no improvement in mucosal inflammation in the pouch body and afferent limb.\\nAt the time of his initial presentation at our Pouch Center, he reported urgency, bowel frequency 12–15 times per day, loose-to-watery stools, occasional bleeding, incontinence, and nocturnal seepage. The Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) symptom subscore was 5.

["Soft-Tissue Myoepithelioma of the Retroperitoneal Space Mimicking a Pancreatic Tumor: A Case Report and Literature Review: A 39-year-old Caucasian man presented with a 1-month history of decreased appetite, mild abdominal pain and palpable epigastric abdominal mass. He was a lifelong nonsmoker with no significant past medical or family history. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a large epigastric mass (14 × 11 × 11 cm) growing from the pancreas with dislocated stomach, duodenum and left-sided portal hypertension (). Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) showed patchy tracer uptake of the tumor located in the pancreatic body and tail (). There was no evidence of regional or distant disease and all blood tests were within normal limits. Upper endoscopy with transluminal ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. Final pathology suggested pancreatic myoepithelioma.\\nThe patient underwent distal pancreatectomy. Intraoperatively, there was tumor compression of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and splenic vein junction with left-sided portal hypertension and severe inflammatory reaction of adjacent tissues. These findings were suspicious for malignant behavior of the neoplasm and led to technical difficulties. Complete removal of the mass required distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, with estimated blood loss 2,800 mL. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on the seventh postoperative day.\\nPostoperative pathology revealed a well-defined multinodal neoplasm with chondroid stroma and monotonous spindle cells having a co-expression of CAM5.2, smooth muscle actin (SMA) and S-100 protein (-). The retroperitoneal STM was adjacent to pancreas without true invasion. The multidisciplinary tumor board recommended a 3 - 6 months follow-up with imaging for 2 years and annual examination for the next 3 years.\\nAt 15 months follow-up, the patient is asymptomatic without signs of malnutrition, malabsorption, or recurrence."]
["Takotsubo cardiomyopathy recurrence with left ventricular apical ballooning following isolated right ventricular involvement: A case report: An 83-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department at Kyung Hee University Hospital (Seoul, Korea) with a left hip fracture resulting from a fall. The patient complained of chest discomfort and mild dyspnea. On admission, the patient’s blood pressure was 128/83 mmHg and heart rate was 108 beats/min. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia with an RSR pattern in lead V1, T wave inversion and poor R progression in leads V1-3 and S1/Q3 (). Serum troponin I was elevated to 0.380 ng/ml. Multi-slice computed tomography pulmonary angiography demonstrated mild dilatation of the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle, as well as mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions (); however, there was no filling defect in the pulmonary arteries. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed akinesia of the apico-mid RV free wall with RV dilatation () and a mild reduction of RV systolic function. LV ejection fraction was preserved (65%) without regional wall motion abnormality. The patient’s coronary angiography was normal. Potential malignancy was excluded by chest and abdominal computed tomography. The symptoms of chest discomfort and mild dyspnea resolved following conservative treatment. Follow-up TTE on the sixth day of hospitalization revealed normalized RV size and function, as well as resolution of the RV wall motion abnormality. The patient underwent surgery for the left hip fracture. On the day after surgery, the patient complained of chest pain and dyspnea. The patient’s blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate were 91/59 mmHg, 104 beats/min and 25 breaths/min, respectively. On ECG, deep T wave inversion was observed to be newly developed in leads I, aVL and V2-6 (). Troponin I levels were elevated to 0.226 ng/ml. Portable echocardiography revealed akinetic and dilated LV apex and hyperkinetic basal segments with an LV ejection fraction of 56% (). The RV function and wall motion was normal. Following conservative treatment, follow-up TTE revealed a good LV systolic function with normal wall motion. The patient was discharged uneventfully. The study was approved by the IRB ethics committee (KHNMC IRB 2013-027)"]
["Identical injuries in 2 sisters (victims of motor vehicle collision): Two cases report: The younger girl (3.7 years old) primary survey revealed that she was irritable, intact patent airway, equal bilateral air entry, tachycardic (144 beat per minute bpm), mildly hypotensive (110/40 mmHg, normal age-adjusted diastolic blood pressure is 46). Secondary survey showed only scalp laceration, with no bruises on the anterior or posterior abdominal wall. She had gross hematuria for which she had been catheterized. Hematuria gradually subsided until disappeared completely by 4th day of admission. Non-enhanced computerized tomography CT brain and maxillofacial scan revealed small hemorrhagic area at left frontal lobe with surrounding edema suggestive of hemorrhagic contusion & no midline shift. Also, posterior falcine and right tentorial hematoma & comminuted fracture of the right mandibular condyle are noted. CT trauma scan revealed multiple lung contusions at posterior aspect of left lower lobe, non-vascularized left kidney except small part at mid-zone and left perinephric and retroperitoneal hematoma (). At delayed phase, no excretion of contrast except from the vascularized part. These data suggest severe (grade IV) injury with shattered left kidney & devascularisation of most of its tissue. Small filling defect is noted at proximal part of left renal vein (denoting a small thrombus).\\nMultiple liver lacerations and moderate hemoperitoneum are noted. Radiographic studies revealed fracture left humerus proximal shaft ().\\nShe was resuscitated by IV fluids and packed RBCs, admitted, and managed conservatively as regard the left renal and other visceral injuries. She had left arm below elbow cast for the fracture left humerus. In the setting of severely injured non-vascularized left kidney, many surgeons would rush to do nephrectomy, but we adopted the conservative management to give this kidney a chance to recover and heal. She improved dramatically in response to this mode of care [the renal parenchyma as well as the collecting system significantly healed as evidenced by repeat U/S 2 months later that revealed re-appearance of the calyces & the normal reniform shape denoting restoration of ∼60% of the renal architecture] (). Also 4 months later, renal dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was done and revealed differential right-to-left renal function of 62%-to-38% respectively. Interestingly, she did not develop hypertension, urinoma, renal vein thrombosis or renal artery aneurysm."]
["Ease of Using a Dedicated Percutaneous Closure Device after Inadvertent Cannulation of the Subclavian Artery: Case Report: A 68-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension was admitted at the Cardiology Department because of massive anterior myocardial infarction with subsequent cardiogenic shock. After initial manoeuvres including sedation, mechanical ventilation, and catecholamine infusion, she was assessed for urgent coronary angiography. Using intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation support, coronary angiography allowed treatment of critical stenosis of the left interventricular and right arteries. The patient was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, and received maximal antiplatelet (clopidogrel and aspirin) and anticoagulation (low-molecular-weight heparin) therapy. Of note, arterial accesses at the both right and left femoral groins were maintained.\\nAn attempt at placing a 7.5F central venous catheter in the right subclavian vein was carried out for monitoring and infusions. This resulted in inadvertent cannulation and insertion of the 7.5F sheath into the right subclavian artery. The poor hemodynamic condition of the patient precluded invasive open surgery, and a decision was made to attempt arterial percutaneous closure, with an 8F collagen plug-based closure device (Angio-Seal, St. Jude Medical) (). Angiography of local arteries was not performed because arterial puncture had been made distal to the right common artery and vertebral arteries.\\nA dedicated 0.035 J-wire was then introduced through the catheter in the artery, which allowed removal of the sheath and insertion of the percutaneous closure device with an arteriotomy locator. The dilatator was then withdrawn and the Angio-Seal device was subsequently inserted and deployed. The patient showed no sign of local hemorrhage or arterial occlusion. A repeat radiograph of the chest excluded hemorrhagic complications including hemothorax (). Antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies could be maintained to preserve the coronary flow. The situation of the patient continued to improve, allowing for removal of mechanical ventilation after 5 days and catecholamine therapy after 7 days. She was discharged from the Intensive Care Unit 28 days following the deployment of the Angio-Seal positioning."]

["Successful Same-Cycle Blastocyst Transfer following Laparoscopic Ovarian Detorsion: A Report of Two Cases and Literature Review: A 32-year-old woman presented in 2010 to our clinic with history of primary infertility for two years. She had polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) according to the Rotterdam criteria [] based on her history of irregular periods and sonographic polycystic ovarian morphology. The patient was initially given 100 mg Clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction followed by intrauterine insemination. After four failed cycles of ovulation induction/intrauterine insemination, a decision was made to proceed with IVF.\\nThe patient underwent stimulation using a combination of 75 IU/day recombinant follicle stimulating hormone with gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist. Transvaginal retrieval of 22 oocytes was performed 36 hours after hCG administration (5,000 IU), and 17 oocytes were fertilized. Three days after egg retrieval, the patient presented with acute severe right lower quadrant pain associated with nausea and vomiting. Upon presentation to our hospital emergency department, her vital signs were stable and her abdominal exam demonstrated right lower quadrant tenderness and guarding with no rebound tenderness. Pelvic sonogram () revealed minimal free fluid in the cul-de-sac, right ovary measuring 85 × 54 mm, and left ovary measuring 71 × 53 mm with multiple residual follicles. Doppler ultrasound study was not available at the time of evaluation. Her white blood cell count was 14.4 × 103 cells/μL with 89% neutrophils. An emergent laparoscopy revealed a 10 × 12 cm purple right ovary twisted 180° around the right infundibulopelvic ligament in addition to a mild right hydrosalpinx.

["Treatment of Fingertip Amputation in Adults by Palmar Pocketing of the Amputated Part: In a case representative of our experience in this series, a 32-year-old woman visited us with a chief complaint of an injury to the right long finger that the patient had sustained in a press machine at a steel press factory. The patient had experienced a complete amputation of Tamai zone I and the amputated part and amputation stump had a relatively clean status (). Although this patient was injured at Tamai zone I, we could not perform a microanastomosis and composite graft because the rate of treatment success has been reported to be relatively low. Because the current case was a non-smoking young woman, the palmar pocketing method with a composite graft was performed to resolve cosmetic problems. The patient had the amputated finger isolated three weeks postoperatively. This was followed by conservative treatment for another approximately three weeks. There was a mild pigmentation in the finger, but this was almost unnoticeable. Overall, the treatment outcomes were satisfactory in our series."]
["A Case of a Nonpetrous Cholesterol Granuloma Presenting as a Temporal Mass: A 67-year-old female presented due to a left temporal swelling of 5 months. She denied history of trauma, discomfort with chewing, audiologic concerns, or history of infection. Physical exam revealed a 2.5 cm fluctuant mass of the left temporal fossa. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the temporal bone showed a 2.3 cm cystic lesion of the left squamosal temporal bone with disruption of the lateral bony cortex (). MRI revealed a nonenhancing, T2 hyperintense lesion (Figures and ). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration was nondiagnostic, revealing only cyst contents. The patient was taken to the operating room where a supra-auricular scalp flap was elevated. A temporoparietal craniectomy was performed to begin removal of the cystic mass en bloc. A limited superior mastoidectomy was performed to exenterate all soft tissues. The mastoidectomy defect was plugged using free muscle and bone wax prior to cranioplasty and closure. Pathologic review of the specimen showed a cyst with cholesterol crystals and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. After 6 months, there has been no recurrence or further complication."]
["Prostatic Adenocarcinoma Masquerading as Generalized lymphadenopathy and Mimicking lymphoma on FDG PET/CT: Diagnosis, Staging, and Evaluation of Therapy Response by FDG PET/CT: A 70-year-old Indian man presented to his physician with a palpable mass in the left cervical and left axillary region that he had noticed 2 weeks previously, and which had gradually increased in size. On clinical examination and ultrasonography, he was found to have enlarged left cervical, left supraclavicular, and left axillary lymph nodes. He underwent whole-body FDG PET/CT at our center for evaluation of generalized lymphadenopathy. The scan showed increased metabolic activity in multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left cervical [largest node measuring 2.6 cm in the short axis, maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) 6.0 gm/mL;], left supraclavicular (, SUVmax 5.8 gm/mL), left axillary (, SUVmax 6.6 gm/mL;), aortocaval, left para-aortic, retrocaval,preaortic, retro-peritoneal, and bilateral iliac regions( SUVmax of left para-aortic lymph nodes 5.9 gm/mL). The abdominal lymph nodes were forming a conglomerate mass () compressing and encasing the inferior vena cava, aorta, left renal vein and artery, left upper ureter, and bilateral iliac veins. Lytic-sclerotic lesions with increased metabolic activity were noted in the sternum, right scapula, fifth lumbar vertebra, sacrum (), right iliac bone, left ischial tuberosity, and neck of the right femur, with SUVmax values ranging from 3.0 to 6.0 gm/mL. The scan also revealed metabolically active disease in the heterogeneously enhancing right lobe of the enlarged prostate gland (size 7.5 × 7.5 cm, SUVmax5.5 gm/mL;). In this case, we suspected prostrate carcinoma with skeletal metastases (Stage IV disease) and the possibility of another neoplastic etiology, such as lymphoma, causing FDG accumulation in generalized lymphadenopathy. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) correlation along with biopsy of the enlarged and hypermetabolic axillary lymph nodes wasadvised. On questioning the patient after the scan, he was found be having mild difficulty in micturation and lumbago. The patient’s PSA level was found to be 4020 ng/mL and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy of the prostate revealed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with a Gleason score of 9 (5+4). The patient underwent subcapsular orchidectomy and was started on hormonal treatment with bicalutamide. With this treatment, the clinically palpable cervical, supraclavicular, and axillary lymphadenopathy was resolved within a month. A follow-up FDG PET/CT scan was performed 3 months after the baseline scan, which revealed complete resolution of the metabolically active lymphadenopathy () and the prostate lesion. The skeletal lesions showed reduced metabolic activity with no significant change in CT appearance. Overall, a good response to hormonal treatment was noticed on the scan. In view of the complete resolution of the FDG-avid lymphadenopathy after orchidectomy and hormonal treatment, we inferred the extensive nodal disease to be metastatic carcinoma of the prostate."]

On 17 November, she complained of fever, diarrhoea and vomiting and on the 18th returned to Paris. She was diagnosed with non-severe (2% parasitaemia) falciparum malaria on 28 November and treated with a 3-day course of atovaquone/proguanil with good outcome. Thirteen days later (day 15) she became confused, aphasic and anosognosic. CSF analysis showed lymphocytic meningitis (Table ). EEG showed frontal bilateral slowing and MRI no abnormalities. Infectious investigations were all negative (including HSV, VZV and enterovirus, HIV, Chikungunya, dengue, West Nile and Rift Valley fevers, yellow fever and African trypanosomiasis). Intravenous acyclovir was stopped after 2 days following the negative result for HSV PCR in CSF. On day 19, she was discharged with partial recovery. On day 22, she was re-admitted for confusion, aphasia, ataxia, delirium, and fever (38 °C). MRI remained unremarkable but EEG showed major frontal slowing and spike-and-wave discharges. Treatment with acyclovir and levetiracetam was re-initiated for 3 weeks. The patient’s clinical status gradually improved allowing for her discharge on day 41. She had fully recovered on day 87."]
["Mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the extracranial carotid artery, a severe and rare disease, a case report: The patient is a 68-year-old male with a past medical history of larynx carcinoma and a radical laryngectomy with bilateral neck dissection. The surgery was performed more than 6 years ago and he never presented complications attributable to the intervention. He arrived at the emergency room (ER) with a high fever and a painful left neck mass. 15 days before arriving at the ER, he developed a general feeling of unwellness, along with high fever and the aforementioned pulsating mass in the neck which had been increasing in size ever since. During the previous 24 h, he developed severe pain around the mass and progressive shortness of breath. There was no history of neck trauma, infection or stroke.\\nOn physical examination, a tachycardic, febrile, and dehydrated patient was encountered. Along with a 15 × 5 × 2 cm beating and painful mass in the left region of his neck, general swelling was observed and the patient reported severe pain on touch. Also, a carotid murmur was audible on auscultation. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable. After adequate resuscitation, complementary exams revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, along with anaemia. Due to the size of the mass, and to aid in the preoperative planning, a computed tomography angiography (CTA) was requested. The results revealed a 10 × 5 × 2 cm hyper-enhanced lobulated lesion involving the left common carotid artery (CCA) and carotid bulb (A, B), and severe swelling of the neck tissues (C). A diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm of the left CCA was suspected, requiring a vascular surgery consultation; an emergency surgery was decided upon deliberation.\\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated and a left neck cervicotomy was achieved with exposure of the left common carotid artery. The circumference of the mass was dissected, and the proximal and distal CCA regions were identified and clamped. The aneurysmal sac was opened and we discovered a ruptured wall of the CCA with inflammation, necrosis and 150 cc of pus. After exhaustive washing of the wound, and since the left carotid artery had some ischemic patches, a saphenous vein graft bypass (A) was used to reconstruct the damaged artery (B).\\nThe postoperative course was unremarkable. A histologic examination of the arterial wall identified the presence of a mycotic pseudoaneurysm with evidence of organisms (Staphylococcus aureus). The bacteriologic profile of the tissue sample showed that the identified S. aureus presented sensitivity to the vancomycin, and therefore the patient received a 10-day cycle of intravenous vancomycin. He was discharged without any complications and, on follow-up controls up to one year after surgery, the patient is doing well."]
["Volume Rendering of Angiographic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography in Fovea Plana and Normal Foveal Pit: A 25-year-old male presented for routine ophthalmologic examination without visual symptoms and a negative history of albinism and any other retinal disease. The best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 with a refractive error of +1.50 diopters spherical equivalent. His OCT findings revealed a grade 1 foveal hypoplasia, according to the classification of Thomas et al. () (). The OCTA examination confirmed the absence of a detectable foveal avascular zone (), and the morphological conformation of the foveal region (, inset) revealed the absence of a discernable ICP. In this case, the anatomical segmentation of the en face OCTA slabs was inaccurate for the irregular contour of the INL at this level. For this reason, the OCTA b scan segmentation and subsequent analysis appeared more accurate and reproducible, as shown in .\\nIt is worthy of note, in this case, that the ICP was not apparent, and the SVC and DCP exhibited direct vertical connections in the central macular region (, insets). At the parafoveal region, the ICP appeared discernible again, presenting multiple interconnections with the SVC and the DCP."]
["Multi Vessel Coronary Artery Disease Presenting as a False Negative Myocardial Perfusion Imaging and True Positive Exercise Tolerance Test: A Case of Balanced Ischemia: A 73-year-old gentleman presented to the cardiology clinic with chest pain on moderate exertion for the last two weeks, which was relieved at rest. He also complained of shortness of breath on moderate exertion with no history of resting symptoms and was asymptomatic at the time of presentation. He was recently diagnosed to have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and had not been started on any treatment yet. He did not have any risk factors for coronary artery disease except advanced age and male gender.\\nOn examination, he had a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98% while breathing in room air. Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm with no significant ischemic changes (Figure ).\\nOther investigations revealed hemoglobin of 13.9 g/dl, total leukocyte count of 70.7x10E9/L, platelets count of 177 x10E9/L, serum creatinine of 0.7 mg/dl, serum sodium of 143 mmol/L, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 5.8 %. His total serum cholesterol level was 159 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was 28 mg/dl and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level was 92 mg/dl. Trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 55% with no segmental wall motion abnormality and there was no structural abnormality.\\nHe was advised to get a stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for the assessment of ischemia. He underwent single-photon emission cardiac tomography (SPECT) with Technetium 99-m (Tc-99). The patient exercised for four minutes on the Bruce protocol and achieved 84% of the maximum predicted heart rate. Technetium-99 was injected at 84% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate. The test was stopped due to exercise limiting chest pain and dyspnea. ECG at peak stress showed >1mm horizontal ST depressions in leads II, III, aVF, and V3 to V5 along with ST elevation in lead aVR (Figure ). ECG changes and symptoms were relieved at six minutes of recovery.\\nMyocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) revealed a small-sized fixed perfusion defect of moderate-intensity in the basal inferior segment (Figure ).\\nAlthough MPI did not show any ischemia, exercise ECG was positive for symptoms and electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia. He was started on aspirin, rosuvastatin, bisoprolol, and then underwent an invasive coronary angiogram, which revealed multi-vessel coronary artery disease (Figures -).\\nHis current treatment was continued and long-acting isosorbide mononitrate added to his treatment regimen. After a detailed discussion with the patient and family members, he was referred to a cardiac surgeon for coronary artery bypass graft."]
["Different treatment approaches for the localized gingival overgrowths: Case series: A 21-year-old female applied to our clinic with a complaint of asymptomatic swelling of gingiva unless traumatized during tooth brushing or eating. Intraoral examination revealed a localized gingival overgrowth extending from marginal gingival to mucogingival of tooth #44 []. Radiographic view showed no bone loss []. After NSPT [], excision of the lesion was planned. Since there was no sufficient amount and thickness of attached gingival, the root surface of tooth #44 was exposed [Figure and ]. Therefore, a gingival unit graft procedure [] was planned, and the recipient site was prepared []. The graft was obtained from palatal area of tooth #14 [Figure and ]. The graft unit was applied to the exposed tooth surface []. The donor site was covered with periodontal dressing, and the patient was prescribed anti-inflammatory drug for 3 days and antibiotics for 7 days. The sutures were removed 1 week following the operation. Histologically, the lesion was diagnosed as “peripheral ossifying fibroma” []. The patient was examined again after 1 month, and healing was found to be satisfactory. Follow-up after 6 months demonstrated no recurrence []."]

["Application of point-of-care ultrasound for different types of esophageal foreign bodies: three case reports: A 32-year-old woman was admitted to ED with discomfort on the neck that occurred 2 h after taking a pill orally. On arrival to ED, she heard sounds of air bubbles coming from her neck when she drank water. She had no dyspnea or fever. Review of system and physical examination were unremarkable except discomfort on her neck. Simple radiography (neck lateral view) did not provide specific findings. Therefore, the emergency physician planned to observe the passage of pills. Otherwise, EGD was planned. During observation, POCUS was performed to detect the esophageal FB by an attending emergency physician with experience of POCUS for 10 years and a faculty in WINFOCUS group. POCUS revealed hypoechoic material suspected FB which did not disappear by swallowing with esophageal bulging above FB which was especially observed in longitudinal view (Fig. ). While observing, her symptoms disappeared. Follow-up POCUS revealed that the bulging esophagus was normalized (Fig. ). The patient was discharged from ED without any complication."]
["Undifferentiated uterine sarcoma metastatic to the brain: A 65-year-old gravida 3, para 3-0-0-3, female presented with postmenopausal bleeding in July 2008. The patient sought medical attention from her gynecologist who performed a D and C, which revealed high-grade sarcoma of the uterus. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis noted 9.5 × 6 cm irregular low density mass in the uterus with no extrauterine disease. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and omentectomy. The tumor measured 10 × 8 cm and demonstrated extensive necrosis. The margins were negative although the posterior wall of the myometrium was extensively involved. The final pathologic evaluation was consistent with undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma. She subsequently underwent pelvic radiation receiving 45 Gy in 25 fractions.\\nOne year follow up imaging revealed multiple lung metastases for which she underwent a needle biopsy, consistent with metastatic undifferentiated uterine endometrial sarcoma. She completed six doses of a single chemotherapy agent, Adriamycin, with good radiographic response on interval CT and positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Three months later she began complaining of headaches and visual complaints. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a homogenous enhancing occipital dural-based mass measuring 1.6 × 1.8 × 1.7 cm with a small amount of surrounding edema []. Due to the rarity of uterine sarcoma metastasizing to the brain, this was believed to represent a meningioma. Interval MRI scan revealed a significant increase in size of the right occipital mass to 2.3 cm with increased edema and mass effect. She underwent right occipital image guided craniotomy for resection of the mass. Postoperative imaging revealed complete resection of the dural-based mass []. Histopathology confirmed UUS metastases [Figures and ]. The patient was discharged on postoperative day one and started on taxol and carboplatin chemotherapy, as well as Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery to the tumor bed."]

["Drug induced toxic epidermal necrolysis: two case reports: A 60-year-old Pakistani male of Caucasoid origin was admitted to the dermatology unit with the following history. He had been operated for cataract 05 days ago. Post-operatively Co-trimoxazole tablets were given. Forty eight hours after taking the tablets the patient developed a severe burning sensation all over the body. This was followed by peeling of sheets of skin over the back, buttocks, thighs and neck. He had had a similar reaction to tetracyclines 12 years ago.\\nInitial examination revealed an asthenic, sick looking man with a B.P. of 130/90 mmHg, temperature 99 degree Fahrenheit and pulse 110/min. Hydration was poor. He was in obvious distress but conscious and oriented. On dermatological examination 40% of body surface area showed peeling of skin in sheets of more than 3 cm leaving behind superficial erosions. The back, buttocks, thighs and anterior aspect of the neck were primarily involved (). Skin tenderness and Nickolsky’s sign were positive. The mucosae were not involved.\\nAt the time of admission the bio-chemical profile was urea 9 mmol/lit, creatinine 274 umol/lit, potassium 3.6 mmol/lit, and sodium 137 mmol/lit. The serum total proteins were 4.9 mg/dl with an albumin level of 3.4 mg/dl and an albumin/globulin ratio of 1.5/1. The blood counts, urinalysis, electrocardiogram and chest roentogram were unremarkable. Skin biopsy showed a sub-epidermal split with necrosis of the epidermis and eosinophilic infiltration.\\nOn the basis of body surface area involved a fluid requirement of 4 lit/24 hours was deduced, half of which was administered as Ringer’s lactate and the other half as glucose saline. He was also put on intravenous Ceftriaxone 1 gm twice daily. The urinary out-put improved and temperature returned to normal. Blood chemistry repeated on the 3rd day revealed no abnormality. The very next day the patient developed multiple purpuric and ecchymotic spots over both thighs. Urgent investigations revealed raised fibrinogen degradation products levels in both urine and blood; however the serum fibrinogen, platelets and bleeding profile were normal. A diagnosis of compensated disseminated intravascular coagulation was made and fresh frozen plasma transfused. Over the next couple of days the skin lesions subsided and fibrinogen degradation products levels returned to normal. Subsequently the patient made an uneventful recovery and all the lesions healed without scarring."]
["Lurbinectedin in Refractory Diffuse Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma: Report of Two Cases: In October 2014, a 66-year-old male, with a history of atrial fibrillation and 40 pack-years of smoking, presented to the emergency department complaining of chest pain. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed pleuropericardial effusion with multiple mediastinal, internal mammary, and right costo-diaphragmatic angle adenopathies as well as signs of peritoneal carcinomatosis infiltrating the large omentum and associated with ascites (). A biopsy of the left cardiophrenic nodule was performed. Histopathology demonstrated the presence of malignant epithelioid mesothelioma. The initial PET-CT showed an involvement of the peritoneal and pleural cavities. The disease being very limited extraperitoneally, the diagnosis of DMPM was retained after multidisciplinary discussion in our tumor board.\\nThe patient was treated with three lines of systematic therapy including immune checkpoint inhibitors and complemented with intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy ().\\nAfter the failure of vinorelbine and gemcitabine in the third line, we proposed a new palliative line based on lurbinectedin in analogy to pleural mesothelioma as part of a compassionate use program. The patient accepted our proposal and we began the treatment in May 2020. At that time, he only had intermittent abdominal pain of grade 1-2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. His performance status was 0 as assessed with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. A PET/CT examination at baseline showed progression of multiple peritoneal implant lesions and an overall metabolic progression of a diffuse pleural affection on the right side ().\\nThe recommended starting dose of lurbinectedin is 3.2 mg/m2 every three weeks (q3wk). However, given that the patient had renal impairment (with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 33 ml/min), the dose was reduced to 50% (i.e., 1.6 mg/m2 q3wk).\\nThe patient’s tolerance to the treatment was very good with grade 1 asthenia, grade 1 diarrhea, and grade 1 abdominal pain that could be easily managed with standard supportive measures. His blood count remained normal. Restaging PET/CT examinations performed at 3, 6, and 9 months of treatment initiation showed an overall metabolic regression of the previously described pleural and peritoneal lesions (). At the last clinical visit in March 2021, more than 6 years after the primary diagnosis, no signs of progression were noted, and the patient continued lurbinectedin with good treatment compliance."]

["Endovascular Treatment of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension with Stenting of the Transverse Sinus Stenosis: A 27-year-old Japanese woman (165 cm, 48 kg) presented with progressive headache, vomiting, and diplopia that had begun 2 months earlier. The clinical examination revealed bilateral papilledema and left abducens nerve palsy. The lumbar CSF pressure was 37 cmH2O. We administered an adequate dose of Isosorbide and glycerol as well as analgesic agents for more than 2 months, but any medical treatment brought about no effect. Routine MRI and CT imaging results were normal (), and an MR venogram showed stenosis of the right TS (). An angiogram depicted the stenotic TS and occlusion of the left sigmoid sinus (). The flow from the left TS was found to drain into the vertebral plexus. Intravenous pressure monitoring demonstrated elevated pressure in the superior sagittal sinus (23 mmHg) and a 4 mmHg pressure gradient across the stenosis. We performed a balloon venoplasty of the sinus with a Jackal balloon catheter (6×40 mm; Kaneka Medics, Osaka, Japan) (, ). Postoperatively the patient’s symptoms remarkably improved and the lumbar CSF pressure decreased to 9 cmH2O. On MR venogram taken 1 week after the operation, the patency with small remaining stenosis was confirmed (), and the patient was discharged without any neurological symptoms.\\nHowever, the patient suffered an increased severe headache again the next month. Her lumbar CSF pressure was observed to have risen to 22 cmH2O, and the papilledema was not improved. An MR venogram taken on postoperative day 42 revealed restenosis at the same TS portion (), and an angiogram also showed the recurrence of stenosis (). We placed a CarotidWall stent (10×31 mm; Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) (), and it achieved complete dilatation without the requirements of any boost of balloon dilatation (). On intravenous pressure monitoring, the 23 mmHg in the superior sagittal sinus with a 6 mmHg pressure gradient across the stenosis improved to 3 mmHg without a pressure gradient after the stenting. The patient’s symptoms vanished just after the stenting and had not recurred at the 6-month follow-up. The papilledema was also remarkably improved ()."]
["High-resolution ultrasound visualization of the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve: normal and first pathological findings: A 45-year-old female presented with a severe paresis of the thenar musculature on her right side for the 6 months prior to presentation. No paraesthesias or pain were reported. Clinical examination revealed plegia of thumb abduction (0/5). A clear thenar atrophy was visible. Sonographic assessment revealed a radially originating, extraligamentously coursing and moderately thickened RMB (1.3 mm). Moreover, the radial-sided motor fascicles within the median nerve were clearly swollen. Further, atrophy of the thenar muscles was assessed (Figs. and ). In accordance with the present findings, this was assumed to be a variant of CTS with involvement of the RMB."]
["Daratumumab: The perplexity in immunohematology with emerging horizons in myeloma therapy: A 66-year-old female was referred to our department for blood grouping and antibody screening. She was a prospective candidate for peripheral blood stem cell transplant for refractory multiple. There was a history of RBC transfusion 7 months ago elsewhere. The patient was typed as Group O, Rh D positive. Antibody screening was positive on Neo Iris (Immucor, INC., Norcross, GA, USA). Antibody identification (Capture-R Ready-ID, Immucor, INC., Norcross, GA, USA) was then performed which turned out to be pan-positive with varying strengths indicating the presence of multiple alloantibodies. The auto-control and direct antiglobulin test (DAT) were negative.\\nExtended typing for Rh, Kell, Kidd, Duffy, MNS, and Lewis group done by tube technique using commercially available antisera (Immucor, INC., Norcross, GA, USA) revealed C + c + e + E-K-Jka-Jkb + Fya + Fyb-M-N + S-Leb-. On crossing out and excluding the antigens for which the patient was positive, antibodies against E, K, S antigens were considered. Yet, there was an unidentified antibody whose specificity could not be ascertained. A re-check of all the results was done. We went back to the patient and his treating clinician and elucidated a detailed history. It showed that the patient was on DARA treatment which could have possibly led to the interference in the immunohematology workup.\\nFor confirmation of the above fact, dithiothreitol (DTT)-treated reagent red cells were tested by the gel card method (IgG + C3d, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.,) in accordance to the method described in technical manual. Autocontrol and DAT were also performed on gel cards.[]\\nThe patient sample was also tested with ficin-treated reagent red cells (Immucor, INC., Norcross, GA, USA) by tube technique at anti-human globulin phase.\\nThe preexisting pattern of reactivity disappeared in both the scenarios and the antibody identification panel was completely negative indicating the interference of DARA in antibody testing in this case. The presence of anti-K antibody was questionable as “K” antigen is destroyed by DTT. However, “K” remains unaffected by ficin, and so its presence was also ruled out.\\nTwo donor units of Group O Rh “D” positive were treated with DTT similar to the reagent cells. After DTT treatment, they were cross-matched with patients' sera and were found compatible. The course of transfusion was uneventful."]

["Torsion of a mucocele of the veriform appendix: report of a case: A 66-year old female patient, with a past medical history of hypertension, presented to the emergency department with a central stomach ache radiating to the upper and lower abdomen. Complaints initiated that morning and were continuously present in varying severity. The pain was accompanied by nausea, vomiting and anorexia. The patient had normal vital parameters with a pulse rate of 82 beats per minute and a temperature of 37.4°C. Physical examination of the abdomen showed tenderness in the suprapubic region. Laboratory results were normal except a leukocytosis of 11.2 x 10*9/L [reference 4–10 x 10*9/L]. Urinalysis showed positivity of nitrate, and presence of some leukocytes and erythrocytes. The presumptive diagnosis was an urinary tract infection for which an urine culture was performed, and antibiotics were prescribed. Because of the atypical presentation, the patient was reassessed at the emergency department the following morning. The complaints were persistent and the abdominal examination still showed tenderness in the suprapubic region but at this moment also in the right lower quadrant (RLQ). Laboratory results showed a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 57 mg/L (reference 0–5 mg/L) and a leukocytosis of 13.2 x 10*9/L. A computed tomography was performed and showed a large cystic lesion with wall calcifications in the RLQ measuring 8.6 x 7.1 x 9.6 cm probably originating from the right ovary (). The appendix was situated in close proximity to this abnormality, and measures 6 mm at the base and 1.1 cm more distally, with infiltration of the surrounding intra-abdominal fat. The appendix looked rotated to caudal. One of the differential diagnosis was a torsion of the right ovarium. An additional ultrasound was carried out by the radiologist to try to clarify the anatomical origin of the abnormalities, but was inconclusive. Informed consent was obtained for a diagnostic laparoscopy with a gynecologist standby. During laparoscopy, inspection of the intra-abdominal genitals showed no abnormalities besides a small myoma of the uterus. The appendix showed a large tumor, which was twisted several times at its base and was purple/ischemic discolored (). After complete detorsion, the appendix was stapled with an endostapler and the appendix was retrieved through a Pfannenstiel incision. The patient recovered without any complications and was discharged home the next day. Histopathologic investigation showed a cystic cavity with a calcificated wall filled with mucus and confirmed the diagnosis of low-grade mucinous neoplasm of the appendix, with reactive changes due to the torsion. There were no signs of perforation and the appendix was removed completely. The patient was discharged from follow up after 8 days."]
["Tuberculosis of Male Breast: A Rare Benign Entity: Herein we present a case of 62-year-old male who presented to our institution with a painful lump in his left breast with chronic sinus formation and pus discharge. According to the patient, the lump had been noticed for one month. The patient had loss of appetite and weight loss. The patient had a history of a common room with his colleagues during trip to an Asian country. The patient did not have any past or family history of pulmonary or extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. He was neither immune-compromised nor a smoker without any comorbidities. On physical examination, the left breast was tender, and an irregular mass of 3 x 2 cm was felt in upper outer quadrant of the left breast with multiple palpable axillary lymph nodes. Hematological and biochemical parameters were within normal limits, including negative testing for HIV. His initial workup included a mammogram which revealed irregular soft tissue density mass in upper outer quadrant of left breast (Figure ).\\nThis was followed by ultrasound which showed irregular communicating branching sinus tracts (Figure ). These were found extending towards left axilla.\\nThere were multiple enlarged lymph nodes in ipsilateral axilla with thickened cortices. The largest one was measuring 2.3 x 1.5 cm with cortical thickness of 0.98 cm (Figure ).\\nA high possibility was raised for communication of these lymph nodes with the sinus tracts leading our diagnosis more towards tuberculosis.\\nPatient's chest radiograph was normal without any evidence of parenchymal or pleural abnormality. The patient then underwent lymph node biopsy to rule out malignant etiology and to confirm the radiological diagnosis. Histopathology (images not available) revealed multiple epithelioid granulomas and multinucleated Langhan's type giant cells. Acute inflammatory exudate was also noted along with areas of caseous necrosis. There was no evidence of malignancy. It was concluded as chronic granulomatous inflammation with necrosis favoring tuberculosis. Histopathology was concordant with imaging and showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with necrosis. The patient received oral anti-tuberculosis therapy for six months without side effect or complications. Informed consent was taken from the patient before writing the case report."]
["Cysts and tumors of the jaws treated by marsupialization: A description of 4 clinical cases: A 10-years-old boy was referred by his dentist for median mandibular swelling with lip and chin hypoesthesia in the last 4 months. The intra oral examination showed a soft tumor filling the vestibule with no dental mobility. The panoramic radiograph (OPG) and the CT scan showed a large cystic and well-defined radiolucent lesion including a canine. The OKC was histologically parakeratinized. The treatment consisted in the marsupialization with weekly changed gauze in the cavity, the extraction of included tooth and the biopsy of cystic wall which confirmed the diagnosis of keratocyst. Parents have accepted this long follow-up period, despite the long-distance constraints of each follow-up appointment, in order to avoid the aggressive treatment for the growing child.

["Myoepithelial carcinoma with contralateral invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast: A 51-year-old woman presented a re-growing remnant mass in the lower central area of left breast, which had already been resected with a mammotome assisted biopsy 6 months ago. Initially, the tumor was recognized as fibroepithelial tumor with fibromatosis. As time went by, the remnant mass started re-growing in the left breast and a newly developed solid mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast was found. Her past medical history or family history of breast cancer was unremarkable. Mammography showed a 0.9 cm sized spiculated, heterogenous nodule at lower central portion of the right breast (). Also a 1.0 cm sized lobulated, iso-density nodule at upper outer quadrant of the right breast was noticed (). On ultrasound examination, a 1.0 cm sized inhomogeneous, irregular marginated and hypoechoic mass was located at the 5 o'clock direction of the left breast () and a 0.9 cm sized multilobulated, heterogenous and hypoechoic mass at 9 o'clock direction of the right breast. Breast conserving surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed for the left breast mass. At a same time, wide excision was executed for the right breast mass. Clear resection margins and no evidence of tumor metastasis in the sentinel lymph node were found in the submitted specimens. Myoepithelial carcinoma and invasive micropapillary carcinoma were found in the left and right breast, respectively.\\nGrossly, the tumor mass from the left breast showed a relatively well-demarcated, multinodular, pale tan to white, and solid consistency with partially infiltrating margins.\\nMicroscopically, the tumor from the left breast was composed of a central lesion with glandular epithelial lined spaces with increased clear changed myoepithelial cells and surrounding predominantly atypical spindle cells at the left lower corner (). At the high power field of light microscopy, the atypical tumor cells showed round to spindle, hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei with relatively abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (). Atypical mitotic figures were easily found throughout the tumor and up to 8 mitoses were counted in 10 high-power fields (). The right breast mass consisted of small clusters of tumor cells within the clear stromal spaces ().\\nImmunohistochemically, spindle tumor cells were diffusely positive for smooth muscle actin (), calponin (), p63 () and pancytokeratin (). The labeling index of Ki-67 at the peripheral portion of mass was more than 40%. On the basis of the histological and immunohistochemical results, we considered this case as a synchronous myoepithelial carcinoma arising in AME and invasive micropapillary carcinoma in both breasts."]
["Total Hip Arthroplasty Indicated for a Tuberculous Coxitis Complicating a Controlled Acquired Imunodefficiency Syndrom Condition: A Preliminary Report Concerning a Case: The subject was a 53-year-old housewife, who consulted in December 2013 for inflammatory pain in the right hip evolving for 3 months controlled with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with a walking distance of about 100 m. The medical history revealed that she is HIV infected and on triple ARV for 1 year, with a CD4 count of 473/ml, the viral load was not documented. Evaluation of the right hip showed flexion/extension of 80/20, abduction/adduction of 40/20, internal rotation/external rotation of 20/15, a trendelenburg gait, and a limb length discrepancy of 3 cm. The muscle power of the gluteus medius was 4/5. There was amyotrophy of the right quadriceps muscle. The Merle d’Aubigne and postel hip score was evaluated to be 9/18. The anterior-posterior view of the pelvic X-ray () shows joint space narrowing, loss of head sphericity, shortened hip length, with no other signs of coxarthrosis (sclerosis, geodes, osteophytes). These findings coupled with the patient’s history of immunosuppression were suggestive of a coxitis, which could be due to tuberculosis (TB) infection. However, an MRI scan was not done because it was unavailable, and the patient could not afford to do it due to financial constraints. The full blood count revealed a hemoglobin level of 13 g/dl, however, the white cell count was 8000 with 45% lymphocytes and 50% neutrophiles. The rest of the laboratory investigation was unremarkable.\\nThe patient was operated for implantation of a THA via the Hardinge approach. During surgery, an incident was encountered while dislocating the hip to resect the femoral head. There was a cream-white liquid that was oozing out of the hip joint (). A sample was rapidly collected per-operative and sent for urgent bacteriological analysis. The gram coloration was negative, the rest of the liquid was then sent for microbiological, mycobacteriological and histological analyses. The debris from reaming and the femoral head () were also sent for analysis. The surgery was continued and completed with the implantation of a hybrid THA due to the fragile acetabulum; the stem was uncemented while the acetabulum was cemented (). The anatomopathological findings showed an active TB infection (). At the end of the surgery, the limb length discrepancy was corrected. The wound healing was normal, and rehabilitation commenced 24 h after surgery with isometric contractions of the gluteal and quadriceps muscles in bed. She was then verticalized the second day following surgery and walking was assisted using crutches. The patient thence continued with her ARV the same day of surgery and 10 days triple antibiotics initiated. She had a fixed combination of antituberculous drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) to be taken for 12 months. 3 years after the surgery we have not noticed any relapse of the infection or any loosening."]
["Epidural Gas Accumulation in Connection with Canine Degenerative Lumbosacral Disease: A 2-year-old intact male cane corso dog was presented for the evaluation and therapy of lumbosacral pain. The results of the general examination were unremarkable. During the orthopedic and neurologic examinations, a clear pain reaction was found during the palpation and extension of the lumbosacral junction. The computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed reduced signal intensity and marked dorsal protrusion of the L7–S1 IVD together with a VP. A surgical dorsal decompression for removal of the protruded disc was performed, and the dog improved to a normal condition within 2 months of rehabilitation.\\nThree years after that surgery, the dog was referred again because the clinical signs had recurred. Palpation of the lumbosacral junction caused pain, and the dog vocalized when standing up or climbing stairs. There were no neurological deficits. A new CT scan showed that a lumbar disc protrusion with an epidural gas accumulation had formed, compressing the cauda equina from the ventral side (Figure ). Surgical exploration was recommended. The cauda equina was approached through the previously performed dorsal laminectomy of L7–S1. The gas-filled cystic structure was a smooth, soft tissue elevation from the vertebral floor and collapsed after an incision was made. The cauda equina was released from its adhesions to the spinal canal floor and IVD. The cystic wall and protruded IVD were removed with a partial discectomy. The closure with a fat graft was routine. The postoperative CT scan showed successful decompression, and the dog improved again and had no signs of lumbar pain in the 3-month follow-up examination."]
["Dual fungal infection with Lomentospora prolificans and Aspergillus fumigatus: A pathogenetic diagnosis elucidated after two decades by sequential examinations: The patient was a 44-year-old Japanese man who developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and who was admitted to Kobe City General Hospital in July 2000 (Day 0). Remission was achieved with chemotherapy. Subsequently, consolidation therapy and intensive maintenance therapy were repeated. In May 2001 (Month + 10), he was hospitalized for a second intensive maintenance therapy session. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed systemic lesions in the brain, right orbit, lungs, spine, and liver during the period of neutropenia. After recovery of the neutrophil count, the right orbital abscess enlarged and compressed the optic nerve. It was surgically removed in June 2001 (Month + 11) due to pain and reduced vision. The resected specimen included the abscess and surrounding bone. The abscess was surrounded by inflammatory granulomatous tissue, and the orbital bone showed black pigmentation, suggesting a phaeoid fungal infection.\\nAs the first choice of chemotherapy, fluconazole was administered in combination with antibiotics; however, the fever continued, and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level elevated. A pathological examination revealed aspergillosis based on H&E staining of the orbital tissues (Figure ), but it could not identify the Aspergillus species. Later, a molecular diagnosis based on the sequence of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of the ribosomal RNA gene using a preserved pathological specimen revealed that the causative species was A. fumigatus (234/236 bases). In the smear culture of the orbital specimen, a slow-growing colony was velvety and olive to dark gray in color (Figure ). The conidia were ovoid to subglobose, smooth-walled, olive to brown, and 7‒8 × 3‒5 μm in size. The fungus was morphologically identified as “Scedosporium prolificans,” in compliance with the taxonomy at that time. At this stage, it became clear that the patient had a dual fungal infection. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for L. prolificans were as follows: amphotericin B, 4 μg/mL; 5-fluorocytocine (5-FC), >64 μg/mL; miconazole, 4‒8 μg/mL; fluconazole, >64 μg/mL; and itraconazole, >8 μg/mL. The sequence of the ITS 1 region of the S. prolificans isolate was identical to the sequence of L. prolificans, according to the previous method.\\nAmphotericin B was administered based on the pathological diagnosis of aspergillosis. The fever and the CRP level gradually decreased. However, the spinal lesions did not decrease, and the CRP level remained > 10 mg/mL. Miconazole was temporarily used for the spinal lesions but was ineffective. Combined therapy with amphotericin B and 5-FC briefly stabilized the clinical status. His leukemia relapsed in September 2001 (Month + 14) and was treated with another series of chemotherapy. The patient's symptoms worsened, and he eventually died of sudden respiratory arrest in October 2001 (Month + 15)."]
["Hemolytic anemia caused by aortic flap and inversion of felt strip after ascending aorta replacement: A 74-year-old woman underwent emergency replacement of the ascending aorta because of Stanford type A acute aortic dissection at another hospital. The entry of the Debakey type I aortic dissection was located in the middle of the ascending aorta, and extended distally to the distal abdominal aorta. The brachiocephalic artery and left common iliac artery were also dissected. Graft replacement of the ascending aorta was done, which were used by Teflon felt strip and GRF glue to reinforce the anastomosis of the dissection aortic wall. The post-operative course was unremarkable except for leg paresis that might have been due to spinal infarction caused by the dissection.\\nShe was diagnosed with a small cerebral infarction, jaundice and anemia 10 years later and admitted to our hospital. Blood tests revealed severe hemolytic anemia. The laboratory results were Hb, 7.3 g/dl; T. BIL, 4.06 mg/dl; and LDH, 3020 IU/l. Microscopy revealed fragmented red blood cells. No stigmata were found that could be associated with TTP or ITP. CT revealed severe stenosis at the proximal anastomosis of the inner felt strip and aortic intimal flap (Fig. ), which was one of two layers of Teflon felt strips positioned using the sandwich technique to reinforce the dissecting aortic wall. The pressure gradient at the site was not measured because it was impossible to insert a catheter. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed mosaic pattern in the felt flap of the ascending aorta although pressure gradient could not be measured (Fig. ). We thus considered that the cause of the hemolytic anemia was mechanical injury caused by disrupted blood flow and repaired the proximal anastomosis.\\nThe patient underwent a second operation. ECC was established via a median sternotomy with a cannula at the distal site of the ascending aortic graft and a two-staged venous cannula in the right atrium. A thrill was felt at the ascending aorta, and we cross-clamped the distal site-of the ascending aorta. We opened the prosthetic graft to explore the proximal anastomosis and found that the inner felt strip was turned up and that it had reduced the diameter of the inner lumen (Fig. ). We also identified local dissection and intimal flap of the proximal site of ascending aorta at non cusupid valve site (Fig. ). The proximal site of the graft, local dissection of the ascending aorta and the Teflon strips were removed, and the ascending aortic was replaced once again with a 22-mm graft that was directly sutured to the previous graft at the distal site of the ascending aorta. The patient was quite easily weaned from ECC and hemostasis achieved without difficulty.\\nThe postoperative course was uneventful, and no fragmented red blood cells or progression of anemia was observed. The serum LDH and T.BIL levels gradually returned to normal."]
["Methotrexate monotherapy for unilateral moderately active thyroid-related eye disease: A 43-year-old diabetic woman presented with a red painful right eye (RE) for 1 month. She had normal vision with no afferent pupillary defect. The RE had elevation and abduction limitation, lid edema, proptosis (RE: 23 mm protrusion, left eye: 20 mm), and Dalrymple's sign (Figure ), with dilated RE conjunctival vessels and normal anterior and posterior segments. MRI revealed right extraocular muscle enlargement (Figure ). Liver functions, free-T3, free-T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were unremarkable. However, TSH-receptor antibodies were positive. She was diagnosed with unilateral active thyroid-related eye disease (TED) and prescribed 60 mg/day oral prednisone with lubricating eye drops. After 2 weeks, however, she was steroid intolerant due to uncontrollable blood sugar and was switched to 10 mg methotrexate weekly. Her condition gradually improved, and six months later, her CAS was 2/10 (Figure ). Methotrexate was gradually tapered over 3 months without relapse for 9 months. During treatment, laboratory investigations remained normal.\\nTED usually occurs with hyperthyroidism but can also occur with hypothyroidism/euthyroidism. It can be unilateral or bilateral and requires detecting anti-thyroid antibodies for diagnosis in euthyroidism. The mainstay of treating moderate-severe TED is glucocorticoids; however, methotrexate monotherapy can be a safe and effective alternative by reducing cellular proliferation."]
["Endovascular stenting with a drug-eluting stent of transplanted renal artery stenosis in a dual kidney transplanted patient: A 60-year-old male with ESRD underwent DKT from a 69-year-old ECD donor, after exhausting all options of getting a suitable criteria donor. The graft kidneys were harvested from the donor using standard organ procurement procedures and both the graft kidneys were transplanted into the right iliac fossa. The patient had an uneventful postoperative period and was discharged on immunosuppressive and antihypertensive therapy. His high blood pressure was controlled with Amlodipine 10 mg/day. He remained asymptomatic on follow-up with adequate blood pressure control and good urine output and had no fluid overload. His creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate were 0.80 mg/dL and 104.8 ml/minute/1.73m2 respectively. However, routine 3-month follow-up Doppler ultrasound revealed increased peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (230 cm/sec and 165 cm/sec, respectively) across one of the transplanted renal arteries with renal aortic ratio (RAR) of 3.9, suggestive of TRAS. Computed tomography angiogram revealed 80% TRAS of the cranially placed transplanted kidney, while the renal artery of the caudally placed kidney was normal (A). A 99mTechnitium diethylenetriamine-pentaacetate (DTPA) scan showed delayed radiotracer uptake by the cranially placed kidney (B). Both kidneys showed preserved perfusion and cortical tracer uptake with adequate clearance, suggestive of good functional status and viable affected kidney.\\nThe patient was considered for endovascular stenting of TRAS. The affected renal artery was selectively cannulated with a 6-French (6F) Judkins Right-4 coronary guide catheter via right transfemoral access and an 80% stenosed lesion (C) was crossed with a ChoicePT coronary guidewire (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA). Following pre-dilatation with a 2.5 × 15 mm balloon, it was stented with a 3.5 × 23 mm everolimus drug-eluting coronary stent (Xience Prime stent, Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The proximal end of the stent was post-dilated with a 5 × 12 mm non-compliant balloon.\\nGood flow was achieved across the transplanted renal artery (D). The patient was discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy along with immune-suppressive drugs. A repeat Doppler ultrasound showed normal flow across the intervened renal artery (PSV: 150cm/sec, end-diastolic velocity: 110 cm/sec, and RAR of 3.1), without any evidence of in-stent restenosis, at 1 year follow-up. His blood pressure remained under control with the same dose of amlodipine (i.e. 10 mg/day). He recently died due to COVID-19 associated pneumonitis after 2 years of follow-up. Informed written consent was taken for the percutaneous intervention of arterial disease. The case report was in accordance with the Helsinki Convention and approved by the institutional ethics committee for the retrospective evaluation."]
["Nephrotic proteinuria and renal involvement in HIV-infected children: A 7-year-old HIV-infected girl presented with jaundice, abdominal pain and clay coloured stools for 2 months. She was diagnosed to be HIV infected 6 months ago by two positive ELISA tests. Her mother was also HIV infected. Other two older siblings were HIV negative. The child had recurrent fever, diarrhea, and bilateral purulent otorrhoea for the past 1 year. She had received antituberculous therapy (ATT) when she was 6 ½ year old and she stopped it after 3 months of treatment. There was no history of blood transfusion. On examination, she had icterus, generalized lymphadenopathy, papular dermatitis and hepatosplenomegaly with bilateral crepitations over both lungs. Blood pressure was 100/70 mm of Hg and there was no edema. Investigations showed hemoglobin of 10.9 gm/dl, WBC count of 19,000/cumm [72% polymorphs, 22% lymphocytes], and platelet count of 2,37,000/cumm. The laboratory findings were as the followings; total bilirubin 7.3 mg/dl with direct bilirubin 6.1 mg/dl, SGOT 125 IU/L, SGPT 57 IU/L, GGTP 56 IU/L, serum alkaline phosphatase 1025 IU/L, total proteins 7.3 gm/dl, albumin 1.7 gm/dl, prothrombin time 18 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 31 seconds. She had hypokalemia (potassium=2.6 mEq/L) with sodium of 134 mEq/L. Ultrasound of abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly with medical renal disease. Urine examination showed presence of bile salts and bile pigments with 2+ proteinuria. Urine albumin/creatinine was 6.6 and 24 hours urine albumin was 47 mg/kg/day. Serum creatinine was 0.6 mg/dl. Hepatitis virus profiles including HBsAg, anti-hepatitis A and anti-HCV ELISA were negative. Chest X-Ray showed bilateral lower zone infiltrates. Serum ceruloplasmin was normal. Antinuclear antibody and double stranded DNA (dsDNA) were negative. There was no Krayer-Fisher KF ring on slit lamp examination. CD4 cell count was 221 cells/cumm (8.16%) with CD4:CD8 of 0.1. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics for the pneumonia but there was no response. She was then started on three drug ATT consisting of ciprofloxacin, ethambutol, and streptomycin in view of tuberculosis defaulter status, liver dysfunction, and non-improving pneumonia. Her bilirubin normalized after 1 month but liver enzymes were still elevated (SGOT=185 IU/L, SGPT=110 IU/L). She was started on enalapril for her proteinuria and underwent a renal biopsy after the jaundice resolved. Light microscopy showed 16 glomeruli with mesangial matrix widening, thin glomerular basement membrane with focal interstitial inflammation, and marginal increase in mesangial cells. On enalapril, her serum albumin increased to 3.7 gm/dl after 3 months of therapy and proteinuria decreased to trace. After 6 months of ATT, she was started on combined ART consisting of zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), and nevirapine (NVP)."]
["Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection: Case Series and Literature Review: A 32-year-old gravida 3, para 3 African American female with no past medical history had recently delivered a baby uneventfully. On postpartum day 9, she developed acute chest pain. It was pressure like, centrally located, aggravated with movement with no relieving factors. It was constant for a week. She went to a local hospital and was found to have elevated blood pressure (170/90 mmHg), but the rest of the vital signs were normal. Physical exam was unremarkable except for lower extremity edema that was improving since delivery. Labs showed mildly elevated troponin I (0.23 ng/mL normal range 0-0.4 ng/mL) and electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal. The rest of labs were unremarkable. Due to concern of ACS, left heart catheterization (LHC) was performed which showed normal coronary arteries. She was monitored in cardiac telemetry unit for two days then discharged home in a stable medical condition.\\nThe patient reported that the pain did not resolve and was worsening after discharge, so she presented to the ED in our hospital after five days of her recent discharge. She described the chest pain as pressure like, centrally located, with radiation to both shoulders. She felt like her symptoms were worse with exertion and better with rest. Vital signs were stable on admission except for blood pressure of 168/88 mmHg. Physical examination was unremarkable.\\nLaboratory evaluations including complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, lipid profile, and coagulation profile were normal. Urine drug screen was negative. ECG showed inverted T waves in V4-V6. Echocardiogram showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%-40%, severe hypokinesia in inferior-lateral wall and apex. No valvular abnormalities were observed.\\nThe patient was started on IV heparin infusion, aspirin, ticagrelor, and atorvastatin. Sublingual nitroglycerin was given. Emergent LHC was performed, which revealed extensive dissection in mid to distal left anterior descending and proximal to distal left circumflex coronary arteries as shown in Figure .\\nHeparin infusion was promptly stopped, and the patient was subsequently admitted to medical intensive care unit (MICU) for monitoring. Given her coronary anatomy with lack of “high risk features”, a decision was made to pursue medical management. She was treated with aspirin, beta blocker, and ACE-Inhibitor. She was monitored in the MICU for 48 hours. She was feeling better, transferred to the general medical floor, and discharged after that in stable medical condition on aspirin, clopidogrel, carvedilol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin."]
["Fatal hemoptysis in patients with advanced esophageal cancer treated with apatinib: A 52-year-old male complained of “dysphagia for 5 months”. Gastroscopy showed a neoplasm in the middle thoracic esophagus. The surface of the mass was uneven, hyperemic, and erosive, and ulceration was formed. The pathologic biopsy result was squamous cell carcinoma. The chest CT examination indicated the obvious thickening of the middle thoracic esophageal wall and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum (). On November 4, 2016, the patient accepted chemotherapy with cisplatin (40 mg, days 1–3) and docetaxel (120 mg, day 1) for one cycle. Five days after chemotherapy, the patient suddenly felt a sharp, tearing pain in the right chest, associated with fever, and the highest body temperature was up to 40°C. The thoracic CT indicated inflammatory changes in the lower lobe of the right lung and homolateral pleural hydropneumothorax. Iodine oil imaging of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed a fistula opening in the anterior right wall of the middle thoracic esophagus. The contrast agent slowly leaked into the thorax through the opening, confirming the occurrence of esophageal fistula due to the rupture of esophageal cancer. On that day, the patient was admitted for the insertion of a drainage tube into the thoracic cavity and placement of a duodenal nutrition tube to maintain nutrient intake. On November 26, 2016, an esophageal covered stent was placed into the esophagus through gastroscopy to block the fistula, and the patient was started on a liquid diet after 24 h. Considering the poor general condition of the patient (performance status score 3), who was unable to tolerate intravenous chemotherapy, treatment with oral fluorouracil (75 mg/twice daily) was started for four cycles, 21 days per cycle. During the treatment, the patient was in a stable condition, the diet was basically normal, and his weight was up about 4.5 kg. On June 12, 2017, the patient was admitted again for progressive dyspnea. At the same time, his daily actions were severely limited. CT examination results showed that the esophageal tumor was significantly larger than before (). On June 16, 2017, the patient began to take apatinib 500 mg/d orally. Three days later, the symptom of respiratory distress significantly improved. Two weeks later, the chest CT revealed that the esophageal tumor was significantly necrotic, and a local cavity was formed (). Subsequently, apatinib was discontinued. On July 4, 2017, a small amount of hemoptysis occurred in the patient, which was stopped using hemostatic drugs. After 4 days, the patient died of massive hemoptysis. The patient had taken apatinib orally for 15 days. During these days, the clotting time examination was normal after 1 week of taking apatinib orally, but 2 weeks later, his plasma prothrombin time (PT 19.9 s, normal 9.8–12.1 s) and APTT (54.20 s) were significantly prolonged. Meanwhile, the other adverse effects such as proteinuria, hypertension, and hand-foot syndrome did not occur."]
["Saphenovenous Graft Aneurysm: A Rare Complication of CABG: Clinical Presentation. We present the case of a 48-year-old male from remote Australia. He reported a history of subacute onset, sharp, central chest pain, stabbing in nature. It was different in character to his previous angina and persisted for hours. He described no associated dyspnoea, palpitations, or diaphoresis.\\nHis cardiovascular profile was hallmarked by insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, end stage renal failure secondary to diabetic nephropathy, recalcitrant hyperlipidaemia, previous cigarette smoking and alcohol intake, and previous coronary artery bypass in 2003. At that time he underwent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft to his left anterior descending artery (LAD) and saphenous vein graft (SVG) to his posterior descending artery (PDA). The patient also had a strong family history of ischaemic heart disease, hyperlipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and renal failure.\\nInvestigations. Our patient had negative serial cardiac enzymes. ECG showed subtle anterolateral T wave inversion. He underwent an echocardiogram with an unanticipated and initially difficult to interpret finding. There was a 4.5 × 5 cm mass intimate and compressing the right ventricular wall. In the context of his ESRF, a noncontrast CT was undertaken to further quantify the lesion. This was suggestive of a large vascular structure with calcified walls, in keeping with an aneurysm. The origin of the vascular structure was indeterminate and the patient ultimately underwent a coronary angiogram (Figures and ). A mid segment left circumflex (LCX) lesion was successfully stented with a drug eluting stent. LIMA to LAD was found to be patent. Angiography of his SVG to PDA identified a unique finding. There was a diffusely ectatic large aneurysm at the proximal end of his SVG to PDA (Figures , , and ).\\nManagement/Follow-Up. His case was discussed at a combined cardiology and cardiothoracic multidisciplinary meeting. The consensus was to pursue conservative management in the first instance and consider surgical intervention at a later date when medical management had been optimized. Aggressive risk factor modification was undertaken, particularly with regard to controlling his recalcitrant hyperlipidaemia. He remained under the surveillance of the cardiology department. After 18 months he returned for elective surgical intervention by ligation with bypass. His procedure was completed without complication and he recovered in cardiothoracic intensive care unit. He was discharged after 5 days and remains well at 6 months."]

Social history was significant for past intravenous drug abuse and 25 pack-year history of smoking (quit 2 years prior). He was treated with several courses of antibiotics for presumed urinary tract infections. Workup included a CT abdomen and pelvis which revealed a 2.3 cm hyperdense mass in the lower pole of the left kidney, multiple subcentimetre renal cysts and wall thickening in the proximal to mid jejunum approximately 2.0×2.2 cm in diameter. Given the incidental jejunal lesion noted on imaging and concern for lymphoma in the context of prior hepatitis C, He was then referred to gastroenterology and subsequently underwent a push enteroscopy for further work-up."]
["SAPHO syndrome with acne fulminans and severe polyosteitis involving axial skeleton: An 18-year-old male patient presented to our outpatient department with painful, nodulocystic acne on the face since 9 months, severe pain in both wrist joints and lower back since 30 days, associated with bouts of chills and rigors, which made patient acutely ill. Patient's elder sister had similar cystic acne lesions on the face, without bony pains or systemic symptoms. Physical examination revealed grade IV acne on face with multiple cysts, which were acutely tender discharging pus [], associated with swelling of right wrist and tenderness over both wrist joints and lumbar spine, with restricted movements due to severe pain. The patient had high-grade fever of 102°F. Other physical findings were normal.\\nComplete blood picture showed mild leukocytosis (16,000 cells/mm3). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 130 mm/1st hour. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are elevated at 24 mg/dL, (normal range <0.80 mg/dL). Rheumatoid Factor was negative and Liver function test results were normal. Blood and urine cultures showed no bacterial growth. Ultrasonograpy of abdomen was normal. Plain radiograph of the right hand showed evidence of a focal osteopenic area at the distal end of radius. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right wrist showed altered signal intensities, at distal metaphyses adjacent to physeal plate on the lateral side of the distal end of Radius, suggestive of osteitic lesions. To evaluate the skeleton, Technetium-99m-MDP Whole Body Bone Scintigraphy (WBBS) was done. Bone scintigraphy revealed increased metaphyseal uptake in distal radius at both wrists and prominent uptake at sacroiliac joints, vertebral end plates, left 7th costovertebral joint, and in addition, there was increased uptake at bilateral sternoclavicular joints and manubrium sternum, known as “bull's head” or “bull-horn” sign, which is characteristic of SAPHO syndrome.\\nInitially, the patient was treated with nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ceftriaxone and ampicillin–cloxaxillin for 2 weeks with no significant relief of symptoms. Later cefpodoxime was started orally at the dose 200 mg twice daily, along with doxycycline 200 mg twice daily and colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily. Acne cysts on the face were drained weekly for 3 weeks, with two simultaneous sessions of intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetate (0.5 mL of 2.5 mg/mL). Clindamycin 1% was prescribed as a topical application, along with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, for acne. The patient responded remarkably to the above treatment and his symptoms subsided in next 4 weeks. At this stage, isotretinoin 20 mg/day was introduced while continuing topical therapy and oral colchicine. By the end of 12 weeks, the lesions on the face flattened [] and bone pains regressed completely. Leukocyte count, ESR and CRP returned to normal. Plain radiograph showed clearance of osteopenic area at the distal end of radius of right hand."]
["Metastatic Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinoma with Osteoblastic Activity: A Case Report of Esophageal and Colonic Primaries: A 49-year-old male with a multiple year history of gastroesophageal reflux disease presented with a six-month history of a 50-pound unintentional weight loss with progressive dyspepsia, reflux, and dysphagia of solids and some liquids. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy identified a large obstructing esophageal mass located at 35–40 cm with unremarkable stomach and duodenum. The distal esophageal biopsy showed invasive moderately differentiated esophageal adenocarcinoma in the setting of Barrett esophagus (). An esophageal stent was placed to help alleviate the patient's symptomatology.\\nDuring the initial exam, the patient reported a firm mass overlying his right shoulder. Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed a 4.7 cm heterogeneous soft tissue mass within the right deltoid muscle lateral to and separate from the humeral shaft (). The radiologic differential diagnosis included sarcoma, vascular origin tumor, and less likely metastasis. The patient underwent an extensive metastatic workup to reveal no additional metastases at that time. Soft tissue resection showed a superficial calcified mass within the subcutaneous and muscular tissue. Histologic examination of this soft tissue mass demonstrated neoplastic glandular cells intimately associated with osteoblastic bone formation with no bone marrow elements (Figures and ). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that these neoplastic glandular cells were diffusely positive for CK7, CK20, CDX-2, and Villin (Figures –) (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). When compared to the initial distal esophageal biopsy, the soft tissue mass morphology and immunohistochemical profile were consistent with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma.\\nSince the patient's initial presentation of dysphagia and soft tissue mass, the patient has undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation. He since has developed progressive disease with new metastases to the pancreas, iliacus muscle, and axillary lymph nodes."]
["Treatment Option for Refractory Postherpetic Neuralgia – Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block: Two Case Reports: The first case was a 59-year-old and 75 kg weighted male patient who was diagnosed with PHN in the right T9-11 dermatomes 4 years ago and he was taking gabapentin 900 mg, acetaminophen 650 mg tid, pregabalin 300 mg bid, and prednisolone 5 mg qd. He was treated 3 years ago with right thoracic epidural steroid injections (T-ESI), T9-11 root block (RB), T11, T12 PRF, and intercostal nerve block; the pain was controlled by medication for 2 years. But, he complained of aching pain and allodynia again in spite of taking same dose of medications; when visiting pain clinic, the NRS was 8. The patient had a medical history of diabetes mellitus, and was taking warfarin 10 mg qd after undergoing prosthetic valve surgery 23 years ago. The most severe painful area was on the right side of the umbilicus (B). Considering the patient was taking warfarin, he was hospitalized for heparin bridging therapy and a TAP block was performed. His international normalized ratio (INR) was 2.16 before performing TAP block. After bridging therapy with low molecular weighted heparin (LMWH), at first block, INR was 1.59. After the TAP block, the NRS of 1 was maintained during hospitalization. Two weeks after discharge, the NRS increased to 3 under taking reduced dose of medication (gabapentin 900 mg tid alone), but the satisfaction level of the patient with respect to the treatment was deemed to be “very satisfactory” according to a four-point Likert scale (unsatisfactory/normal/satisfactory/very satisfactory), which was higher than that with other treatments (i.e., “normal”). Six months after discharge, the NRS was maintained as the same."]
["Laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy for a patient with right-sided ligamentum teres: A 63-year-old man with a past history of rectal cancer was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of CRLM. The patient had undergone laparoscopic high anterior resection to treat rectal cancer 7 months previously. The pathological stage of the rectal cancer was T1N1aM0 stage IIIA, according to the Union for International Cancer Control classification (seventh edition). The patient did not experience any perioperative complications. He refused to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Computed tomography (CT) performed 7 months after primary surgery revealed liver metastasis in the left lateral section. Indocyanine green retention at 15 min (ICGR15) was 4.1%. The patient’s Child-Pugh classification was class A. Tests for hepatitis B virus surface antigen and antibodies against hepatitis C virus were negative. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT revealed a hypovascular tumor of 38 mm in size in the left lateral section (Fig. ). The ligamentum teres was observed on the right side of the gallbladder (Fig. a, b). Three-dimensional CT clearly showed that the umbilical portion of the portal vein was located on the right anterior portal vein, where the RSLT connected (Fig. ). Considering the segmentation of the liver according to the Brisbane 2000 terminology [], the right anterior branch of the portal vein was ramified from the right portal vein. The lateral superior branch of the portal vein (P2) branched off behind the bifurcation of the portal vein, running separately from the common branch of the lateral inferior branch (P3) and left paramedian branch (P4). The patient was diagnosed with CRLM, and LLLS was planned. We fixed the patient in the supine and open-leg position and inserted four ports. The intraoperative findings showed an RSLT with a left-sided gallbladder (Fig. a). After mobilizing the left lateral section, the resection line was carefully decided by identifying the origin of the P3 and P4 of the portal vein using intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) (Fig. b). The P2 was independently ramified from the left portal vein and was identified by IOUS (Fig. c). The resection line was on the left side of the falciform ligament. Liver resection was performed using an ultrasonic scalpel (Harmonic Scalpel; Ethicon, CO) and repeatedly using IOUS to ensure the resection of the lateral superior branch of Glisson (G2) and lateral inferior branch of Glisson (G3) (Fig. d). The G3 and the G2 had to be separately clipped and resected, because of the wide distance between the two branches on the resection line (Fig. e, f). The vein draining the left lateral superior section (V2) and left hepatic vein (LHV) were resected at the cut surface, and the left paramedian branch of Glisson (G4) was correctly preserved using intraoperative ultrasonography. The operation time was 2 h and 58 min and the intraoperative blood loss was 50 g. The patient had a favorable clinical course without any complications and was discharged on postoperative day 5."]
["Hepatic metastases of primary jejunal carcinoid tumor: A case report with radiological findings: A 66-year-old woman presented our hospital with complaints of hematochesia and melena. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly and a mass alining from right upper quadrant to epigastrium. On laboratory examinations blood analysis revealed deep anemia (hemoglobin: 3.6; red blood cell: 2.34), and blood transfusion was induced to the patient.\\nOn abdominal US, hepatic echogenous mass lesions the biggest being 14x10cm in size having cystic components were demonstrated. Also a 5×4cm hypoechoic mass lesion neighboring to pancreatic tail protruding into the lumen from the jejunal wall was noted, which contained calcifications. Abdominal CT revealed heterogeneously enhancing hepatic mass lesions having central necrotic areas and a lobulated contour (Fig. , ), and a heterogenously enhancing jejunal mass lesion having calcified areas (). With these radiological findings, a presumptive diagnosis of jejunal carcinoid tumor and hepatic metastases was made.\\nOn the other hand, DWI was performed for the differential diagnosis of hepatic masses from cavernous hemangiomas, which revealed restriction in diffusion and an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value of 1,33×10—3 which was compatible with the ADC values of hepatic metastatic lesions [20] (). The jejunal mass was also displaying restriction in diffusion. US-guided tru-cut biopsy of the biggest hepatic mass lesion was evaluated as carcinoid tumor metastasis histopathologically."]
["Micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma diagnosed 10 years after the first operation: a case report: A 70-year-old Japanese woman who had undergone resection of a thymic cyst by video-assisted thoracic surgery via the left thorax 10 years earlier was found to have a solid nodule with a multilocular lesion at the site of the previous operation. She had no remarkable medical history aside from the tumor and was not taking any medications. She had no tobacco smoking or drinking of alcohol habits, or significant family history. In addition, she was a clerical worker with no exposure to cancer-causing agents. Her physical examination and laboratory findings, including tumor markers, were within normal ranges. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of her chest revealed a solid nodule with a multilocular lesion (30 × 30 × 15 mm) at the anterior mediastinum. The solid component was heterogeneously enhanced, and the cystic component was not (Fig. b). Retrospectively, the CT findings obtained before the previous operation showed a thymic cyst and a small nodule in the cranial section of the cyst (Fig. a). Only the cyst was resected with the partial thymus, and the nodule remained after the previous operation 10 years earlier. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the solid component was iso-intense on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), while the cystic component was iso-intense on T1WI and highly intense on T2WI; there was no evidence of invasion to the surrounding organs.\\nGiven the possibility that the tumor was malignant (for example, thymoma or thymic carcinoma), we performed trans-sternal radical thymectomy. The tumor was located at the left inferior pole of the thymus, and the cystic component contained serous fluid. There was no dissemination or adhesion. A pathological examination showed that the tumor size was 3.7 × 2.5 × 1.0 cm. On microscopic examination, the tumor was composed of small nodules and abundant lymphoid stroma (Fig. a, b). The nodule consisted of short spindle-shaped and oval-shaped epithelial cells that resembled type A thymoma. The lymphoid stroma was composed of normal lymphocytes, and normal lymphocytes formed lymphoid follicles partially. On immunohistochemistry, the epithelial tumor nodules were positive for cytokeratin (AE1/3), and the lymphoid stroma was positive for CD3 and CD20 (Fig. c–e). Furthermore, there was linear connective tissue in another slice of the tumor that was probably a scar from the previous operation (Fig. f–h). Reassessment of the thymic cyst resected 10 years earlier revealed a few of the same nodules and lymphoid stroma in the wall of the cyst. The nodule and stroma showed the same immunohistochemical staining pattern as the present case (Fig. ). This indicated that only the cystic component of MNT was removed at the previous operation, and the residual lesion grew over the subsequent 10 years.\\nThe residual lesion was completely removed with the thymus, and there was no recurrence at 2 years after the operation."]
["Outcome of Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis according to the length of antibiotic therapy: Preliminary data from a cohort of 78 patients: Case 2 (6 weeks): The patient was a 53-year-old man with Child B alcoholic cirrhosis who had been diagnosed with aortic native valve EFIE without HLAR in 2008. He had been treated with 6 weeks of ampicillin/gentamicin because of a periannular abscess. The patient was not initially considered a candidate for surgery owing to the high surgical risk. After a relapse 4 months after completing treatment, he was transferred to our center to be evaluated for surgery, since he had developed massive aortic insufficiency and an aorto-ventricular fistula. He developed renal failure after 3 weeks of treatment with ampicillin/gentamicin; therefore, therapy was switched to ampicillin/ceftriaxone. The patient completed 6 weeks of therapy with negative blood cultures and no fever. He underwent cardiac surgery, but died 20 days later from postsurgical multiorgan failure."]
["Focal nodular hyperplasia: with a focus on contrast enhanced ultrasound: A 32-year-old male was admitted with the complaint of an asymptomatic liver mass that had been discovered by ultrasonography (US) during a medical check-up (). He had no previous history of medical illness or alcohol intake. Biochemical tests showed that the serum level of alanine aminotransferase was 22 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase was 19 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase was 75 IU/L, and total bilirubin was 0.6 mg/dL. The levels of tumor markers were alpha fetoprotein at 5.9 ng/mL, carcinoembryonic antigen at 1.1 ng/mL, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 at 7 U/mL. The results for hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HBs, and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were negative. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hypervascular mass with a central scar in S5 of the liver ().\\nCEUS was subsequently performed using a color Doppler ultrasonic scanner (Prosound alpha 10 premier, Aloka, Tokyo, Japan) with the injection of contrast agent (SonoVue, Bracco Diagnosis, Italy) for real-time dual-flame harmonic imaging of the mass. The mass appeared spoke-wheel like during the arterial phase, and its enhancement persisted until the late phase (, Video at ).\\nA percutaneous fine-needle-aspiration biopsy was performed under ultrasound guidance, and a histologic examination of the biopsy specimen showed a fibrous scar with anomalous blood vessels (). The characteristic imaging findings and the biopsy results led to a final diagnosis of FNH of the liver. He was recommended to receive regular follow-up of the hepatic lesion."]

["A Case of Lung Adenocarcinoma with Pulmonary Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy Showing Pathological Complete Response to a Pembrolizumab-Containing Chemoimmunotherapy: A 65-year-old woman, an ex-smoker with a Brinkman index of 800, with a past history of breast cancer, urothelial cancer, and ischemic heart disease presented cough for several months. Plain chest X-P showed a mass in the right lung field and enlargement of the right lung hilum (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) showed well-defined oval masses in the lung with apparent hilar lymph node enlargement. Laboratory testing showed no significant tumor marker elevations. Pathological examination of the transbronchial lung biopsy specimen showed large oval atypical cells with mucin formation in some cells. Immunostaining showed that the atypical cells (Fig. ) were TTF-1, napsin A, CK5/6, CD56, synaptophysin, and chromogranin negative, Alucian blue positive, p40 and p63 focally positive, and PD-L1 weakly, that is,1%, positive. Molecular testing showed that no molecular mutations were observed in epidermal growth factor receptor exons 18–21. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed maximum standard uptake values of 8.0 and 14.1 in the 2 tumors located in the right lower lobe and those of 6.3 and 5.3 in the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, respectively, but no significant accumulation in the bone (Fig. ). The patient with digital clubbing and cortical and periosteal thickening of the tibias complained of polyarthralgia after the onset of cough, leading to the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. The presence of 2 lung cancers in the right lower lobe suggested the T category in this case as at least T2, that is, more than 3 cm in size, or T3 with possible pulmonary metastasis in the same lobe. In addition, bulky presumed hilar lymph node metastasis could lead to inevitable pneumonectomy when primary surgery was applied to the patient. We, therefore, treated the patient with primary chemoimmunotherapy using pembrolizumab (400 mg q3w), carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min q3w), and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 q3w). The patient showed prompt symptom relief, that is, disappearance of the cough and polyarthralgia with manageable side effects. Due to the quasi-complete remission of the lung cancers and the marked shrinkage of the presumed lymph node metastases (Fig. ) with 3 courses of the chemoimmunotherapy, the patient underwent lower lobe lobectomy and hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Pathological examination showed no viable cancer remnants in the lung tumors and lymph nodes dissected (Fig. ). The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 9th day after operation."]
["Novel intragenic deletions within the UBE3A gene in two unrelated patients with Angelman syndrome: case report and review of the literature: Patient 2 is a 5 year-old girl born at term following an uneventful pregnancy. Her birth weight was 3000 g. No perinatal problems were reported but she was noted to be hypotonic. She presented developmental delay. Unsupported sedestation was achieved at 8 months and independent walking at 24 months. Oral language was limited to around 10 words.\\nPhysical features of the patient included prognathia, wide mouth and wide-spaced teeth. The neurological manifestations included severe intellectual disability, ataxia of gait, uplifted and flexed arm position during deambulation, speech impairment, frequent drooling and seizures. The EEG showed generalized slow wave activity with paroxysmal activity. She didn’t present disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle.\\nThe behavioral traits included a happy demeanor with smiling, laughing, hyperactive behavior, attention deficit, hand flapping and chewing/mouthing behaviors. At the age of the diagnosis, 5.6-year-old, her weight was 15 Kg (10th percentile) and the head circumference was 48 cm (−1.5 SD) (Table ).\\nInitially, MLPA analysis was carried out using the SALSA MLPA P064 Mental Retardation probemix-1 in the Mother and Child Health Care Institute of Serbia. The results showed a deletion of the exon 10 (NM_130838.1) of the UBE3A gene (data not shown). Subsequently, a DNA sample of the patient was sent to our laboratory for further studies. MS-MLPA testing was performed and showed a normal methylation pattern. However, a reduction of 50% in the relative peak height of the probe corresponding to the UBE3A exon 9 was observed while probes corresponding to UBE3A exons 1, 2, 3, 4 (NM_130838.1) showed a normal diploid dosage (Fig. ). To confirm the UBE3A exon 9 and 10 deletion and to determine whether the deletion expanded to other exons, MLPA P336-A2 kit was used. MLPA analysis confirmed the deletion only involving exon 9 and 10 (Fig. ). The genetic analysis in the parents showed that the deletion encompassing exons 9 and 10 was de novo (Fig.). In patient 2, two SNPs in intron 9: rs573271880, rs17115485 and 1 SNP in exon 10: rs10047992 were analyzed to investigate the parental origin of the deletion. As in patient 1, we could not confirm the maternal origin of the deletion."]
["Complete and Fast Recovery from Idiopathic Facial Paralysis Using Laser-Photobiomodulation: AMFC, a 71-year-old female patient, presented with a sudden onset of unilateral facial paralysis preceded by pain in the masticatory muscles (masseter and temporal). She sought an emergency service on March 4th, 2018. After cranial tomography for the differential diagnosis in relation to a possible transitory stroke, the neurologist diagnostic was Bell's palsy. In our first evaluation (Figures and ), we classified the case as grade V (severe), according to the House-Brackmann Scale (). This classification will be detailed later in the discussion topic. Laser-photobiomodulation was proposed and initiated on March 5th.\\nA low-level laser (brand: DMC™) was previously measured to have a 100 mW output power density with a fiber diameter of 600 μm.

["The Diagnostic Dilemma of Neurolymphomatosis: Mr. D, 62-year-old male presented with an 8-month history of paresthesias and pain in both hands and feet and 1-month history of numbness of the right side of the face as well as weakness in both upper limbs. He had no systemic complaints. On examination he had weakness of the small muscles in both hands and bilateral hip flexors. The pain and touch sensations on the right side of the face were decreased by 40%. NCSs revealed sensorimotor axonal neuropathy in all four limbs with evidence of a conduction block in the right ulnar nerve. A possibility of vasculitic mononeuritis multiplex was evaluated in detail. Detailed hemogram and biochemistry investigations produced normal findings. FDG-PET revealed intense uptake in the palatine tonsils, left breast, mediastinal, axillary and hilar lymph nodes, bilateral humerus and left testis (). A CSF examination showed 10 cells/HPF, protein at 59 mg/dL, and sugar at 104 mg/dL. A axillary lymph node biopsy revealed diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, and a sural-nerve biopsy revealed infiltration by lymphomatous cells (). He was started on chemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin and prednisone (the R-CHOP regimen). He improved initially but returned after 3 months with difficulty walking, at which time he was found to have cerebellar ataxia. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain produced normal findings. The CSF contained lymphomatous cells suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) involvement by lymphoma cells. He was further treated with whole-body radiation and chemotherapy, but succumbed to his illness. An autopsy was not performed since his relatives did not give consent."]
["Meiotic prophase I defects in an oligospermic man with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome with ring chromosome 4: The patient was a 23-year-old man who presented at our center for oligospermia. The patient showed signs of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. He had left-side cryptorchidism. His right scrotal testis was slightly soft and small (12 mL; normal testes size for adult Chinese 19.8 ± 7.1 mL). His penis was appropriate in size. Semen analysis revealed a semen volume of 1 ml, sperm concentration of 2.81 million per ml, and motility of 14.63%, with a total motile sperm count of 0.41 million. A repeat sample 2 weeks later showed a semen volume of 1 ml, sperm concentration of 0.73 million per ml, and motility of 12%, with a total motile sperm count of 0.09 million. A CT brain scan found no abnormality. Abdominal ultrasound revealed no visceral anomalies. Intelligence was in the lower limit of the normal range. After obtaining informed content from the patient and his parents, biopsy was performed on the right testis. Histology of the testicular biopsy sample showed the number of primary spermatocytes was reduced, and spermatogenic arrest at the primary spermatocyte stage (Figure ).\\nHormonal profile was normal for serum concentrations of PRL, LH, and T. FSH concentration was higher than normal (18.9 IU/L, normal value 1.0-5.5 IU/L). Y-chromosome screening for AZF microdeletions was normal.\\nKaryotype analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes by classic G-binding revealed 46,XY,r(4)(::p16.3 → q35.2::)[31]/45,XY,-4[3] (Figure A). To characterize the ring chromosome 4, molecular cytogenetic analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP array 6.0 platform (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Array data were analyzed using Genotyping Console software. The results indicated a terminal 852 kb deletion at 4p16.3 that included 17 annotated genes (MIRN571, LOC654254, ABCA11, LOC642707, ZNF141, ATP51, GAK, ZNF595, MGC26356, ZNF718, MFSD7, PDE6B, PCGF3, MYL5, PIGG, ZNF721, and CPLX1) (Figure B).

At the time, since the last 6 weeks, she repeatedly complained to her son that her daughter-in-law was “out to get her.” She was certain that her daughter-in-law was poisoning her food. Frequent quarrels ensued at home. Her appetite took a toll. She further added that there were “voices” of unfamiliar men, who commented on all her daily activities. Two weeks ago, she was seen trying to strangulate herself in order to make the voices stop. Medication was started, but discontinued immediately as she was certain it was poisonous and one of her daughter-in-law's many plots. Sleep eluded her. No significant past history. She was premorbidly described as suspicious and introverted. She was physically well, at ease, oriented and expressive. No affective symptoms or formal thought disorders. Persecutory, well systematized delusions against the daughter-in-law, along with partition delusions, in which she believed that daughter-in-law, would transgress the walls of her room and kill her at night were present. Third person auditory hallucinations with sinister content were present continuously. Neuropsychiatric examination revealed no abnormality. Her mini-mental status examination (MMSE) score was 28/30, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) was 96/100. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed age related cortical atrophy.

["Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: A diagnostic challenge in a rare presentation: A 39-year-old male patient presented to the hospital with complete loss of conscious that preceded by headache since the previous day. The patient admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit as a case of coma for investigation. Medical history and clinical examination gave no obvious cause of coma. Routine laboratory investigations including complete blood count and random blood sugar revealed unremarkable results. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed an ill-defined hypodense area in the left upper parietal lobe that suggested encephalitis or infarction as a diagnosis. MRI showed low SI area in the left upper parietal lobe with effacement of the cortical sulci and thickened gyri that were high SI on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). These findings also suggested the diagnosis of encephalitis, but the patient was afebrile and not immunocompromised. Diffusion-weighted (DW) was requested to exclude cerebral infarction that showed diffusion restriction of the lesion and suggested infarction as a diagnosis. MR angiography (MRA) was normal and not compatible with an arterial infarction.\\nOn the next day: Gadolinium-DTPA injection was given, T1WIs showed a filling defect in the SSS that represent the “cord sign” of sagittal sinus thrombosis []. Gadolinium-enhanced MRV showed a persistent filling defect in the SSS on the sagittal images [] and also in the left transverse and sigmoid sinus on the axial images [] that confirmed the diagnosis. The final diagnosis was SSS, left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis with left parietal lobe venous infarction. Anticoagulant drugs were given to this patient and improvement achieved."]
["Subaxial cervical Castleman’s disease: A rare cause of myelopathy: A 52-year-old male presented with 2 weeks of a progressive quadriparesis (i.e. loss of dexterity in both hands and lower extremity weakness) and urinary incontinence. He also had cervical lymphadenopathy (i.e. anterior/posterior and post-auricular lymph nodes). On exam, he had 4/5 weakness in both lower extremities, diffuse lower extremity hyper-reflexia with bilateral Babinski responses, and a T2 sensory level (mJOA-10/18).\\nThe X-rays and CT scan revealed a destructive lytic C2-C4 lesion focused at the C3 level vertebral body (i.e. destructive lytic lesion of anterior/posterior C3, the C2 spinous process, and anterior C4 vertebral body) []. MRI showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the neck along with lytic lesions involving C3 (i.e. both anterior and posterior elements). Furthermore, an epidural soft-tissue mass causing spinal cord compression was seen posteriorly at the C3-4 level. Although predominantly dorsal, the lesion wrapped circumferentially around the spinal cord bilaterally. The lesion was isointense to hypointense as compared with the spinal cord on T2 weighted images and hyperintense to cord on the T2-weighted image [] The PET CT confirmed increase uptake at C3 alone []. The predominant differential diagnoses included lymphoma or metastatic tumors or infection.\\nIn view of a Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score of 14, the evidence of spinal cord compression and likely instability, the patient underwent a C3-4/laminectomy with C2-4/5 posterior fusion. At surgery, the posterior cervical paraspinal musculature infiltrated by tumor and had to be removed. A novel “three rod construct” fusion was performed that included C2 pedicle screws, laminar screws, a C4 left pedicle screw with lateral mass fixation of C4 and C5 []. The frozen section diagnosis was lymphoma. Postoperatively, the patient had complete neurological recovery except for bladder dysfunction.\\nHistopathology was consistent with a lymphoproliferative disorder (i.e. with follicles of different size with abnormal germinal structures at their centres with hyaline-vascular or “burnt-out” appearances) [].

["Traumatic Blunt Force Renal Injury in a Diseased Horseshoe Kidney with Successful Embolization to Treat Active Bleeding: A Case Report and Literature Review: A 57-year-old man had a head-on collision motorcycle road traffic accident to a street light pole in speed less than 40 km/h because of an acute stroke. His vitals on arrival are as follows: blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate 140 bpm, and saturation 98%. The Advanced Trauma Life Support principle was performed, which revealed that he was transiently responsive and suffered grade 2 hemorrhagic shock. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) was negative in all four quadrants. Physical examination found soft, no distension, no abdominal contusion, or peritonitis. A Foley catheter was inserted, which showed clear, yellow urine (200 ml).\\nThe patient underwent whole body computed tomography (CT) scan by indication of blunt abdominal injury with hypovolemic shock grade 2, which revealed a retroperitoneal hematoma measuring 6.9 × 6.1 × 12.3 cm and multiple lacerations of the lower pole of the kidney. A CT brain (as part of whole body CT scan) shows acute ischemic stroke on MCA distribution. These findings were compatible with preexisting disease of his horseshoe kidney without a concomitant intra-abdominal organ injury or urinoma (Figures and ) There was active extravasation of contrast agent from the accessory right renal artery feeding into the lower pole of the right wing of the horseshoe kidney. This finding suggested that his transient responsiveness and grade 2 hemorrhagic shock were due to active retroperitoneal bleeding (Figures and ).\\nBleeding from the accessory right renal artery was managed successfully via endovascular coil embolization (). The patient's renal function was impaired on postembolization day 1, with the serum creatinine at 2.33 mg/dL as compared to baseline serum creatinine at 1.32 mg/dL before undergoing whole body CT scan, which recovered to 1.58 mg/dL on postembolization day 3. The patient, however, developed a low-grade fever on postembolization day 7. He then underwent CT whole abdomen, which identified an infected hematoma from a finding of multiple air-fluid level with previous hematoma. It was successfully treated with an antibiotic, without surgery. The empirical antibiotic Ceftriaxone was used based on the clinical sepsis in an immunocompetent patient of intra-abdominal infection []. At the 6-month follow-up, his serum creatinine level had returned to normal (1.09 mg/dL). Informed consent to publish the case was obtained from the patient."]
["A Rare Cause of Angina After Coronary Bypass Grafting; Left İnternal Mammary Artery to Pulmonary Artery Fistula and Successful Treatment with Transcatheter Coil Embolization: Fifty-three years old male patient who has a history of 2-vessel CABG in 2009 in which his LIMA was anastomosed to LAD and ramus artery sequentially admitted to our outpatient clinic with symptoms of typical angina and shortness of breath despite optimal medical therapy. Coronary angiography demonstrated 60% stenosis of proximal right coronary artery (RCA) with an FFR value 0.87, 90% stenosis of native ramus artery and a fistula formation from LIMA to PA before anastomosing to LAD and ramus artery (). Computed tomography (CT) angiogram of coronary arteries and bypass grafts confirmed the diagnosis of fistula and its course. After consulting the patient with the Heart Team including cardiothoracic surgeons and anesthesiologists in sense of treatment strategy, we decided to completely revascularize the patient with stenting native Ramus artery and closing the fistula with transcatheter coil embolization in the same procedure. Our rationale for treating native ramus artery in the same procedure was aiming to block the sequential flow coming from LIMA by competing with it, which will result in augmentation of LIMA to LAD flow.\\nAfter stenting ramus artery with a 3.0 x 15 mm drug-eluting stent, we carefully engaged the ostium of LIMA with an 8 French internal mammary artery (IMA) guiding catheter and advanced a 0.014’’ PT guidewire to the distal part of fistula. Next, 2.8 French CANTATA microcatheter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) was advanced to the midportion of fistula over the PT guidewire. Since the fistula was draining to PA with two major side branches which were dividing to multiple collaterals into their distal portions, our initial strategy was occluding the two major branches of fistula individually. However, the first coil (11-2-2 HL spiral, Detach Coil System, Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) was distally embolized inadvertently and the other two coils (11-3-4 HL spiral and 18-4-6 HL spiral) for each side branch could not completely occlude the fistula (). Hence, we changed our strategy and deployed an additional three larger coils (18S-5-7 HL spiral, 18S-6-8 HL spiral, 18S-6-15 HL spiral) to the main branch of fistula. After waiting for a few minutes, control angiography of LIMA demonstrated total occlusion of the fistula without any complication (). The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged without any complication and symptom."]
["Renal Transplant Hydroureteronephrosis as a Manifestation of Rejection: An Under-Recognized Entity?: An 8-year-old obese African American boy underwent a preemptive deceased donor RT for ESRD secondary to PUV 5 years ago. Non-antireflux ureteroneocystostomy of a single transplant ureter with ureteral stent placement was done. There was an immediate graft function. IS consisted of tacrolimus, MMF, and steroid. His vesicostomy was closed and PUV was ablated at 19 months of age. There were no episodes of transplant pyelonephritis. Two years post-RT, he was treated for ABMR with pulse steroid, plasmapheresis, IVIG, and rituximab. Baseline allograft sonogram showed no HUN. Four years post-RT, he presented with an asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine from a baseline of 0.8–2.2 mg/dL, with stable serum electrolytes. Viral PCRs were negative. Allograft sonogram showed a new-onset moderate HUN without calculus; post-void residual bladder volume was minimal. Urine output was normal. Urethral catheterization was not required. Voiding cystourethrography and diuretic renogram were not done. DSA were positive for DQ5 (>15,000 MFI), DPA1 (7,000 MFI), DP3 (3,000 MFI), and B7 (4,000 MFI). Allograft biopsy showed mild glomerulitis, peritubular capillaritis, PTC C4d deposition, mild to moderate intimal thickening of the small arteries without vasculitis, interstitial fibrosis (30–40%), and global glomerulosclerosis (30%). He was treated with pulse steroid, IVIG, and four doses of rituximab. Subsequent DSA 3 months later showed very weak DQ5 (3,000 MFI). One year later, serum creatinine has remained stable at 1.2 mg/dL with absence of HUN."]
["Giant Posterior Mediastinal Ancient Schwannoma Requiring Thoracoabdominal Resection: A Case Report and Literature Review: A 47-year-old obese man with severe mid-back pain for 6-months was found to have a large intra-thoracic mass on a routine plain film of the chest. A computed topography (CT) scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed a 20.5 × 15.5 × 16.0 cm heterogeneous mass in the left posterior mediastinum with effacement of the left lower lobe, left inferior pulmonary vein, displacement of hemi-diaphragm inferiorly and mediastinal structures towards to the right chest (). A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study revealed peripheral enhancement and internal necrosis (). CT-guided biopsy revealed a spindle cell tumor. Surgical resection was recommended.\\nA left thoraco-abdominal incision was made, extending along the 8th inter-space along the thorax (). Exposure was enhanced by resection of the 9th rib. The tumor abutted the descending aorta, and was adhered to the left lower lobe of the lung posteriorly as well as the adjacent diaphragm. Resection required en bloc wedge resection of a portion of adhered left lower lobe and the hemi-diaphragm. An extra-pleural dissection was undertaken to ensure adequate chest wall margins and along the thoracic aorta, a subadventitial resection was performed. The tumor appeared to originate from the nerve root in the area of 10th thoracic vertebra (). Frozen section of the pleural margin was found to contain no tumor. The diaphragmatic defect was primarily repaired.\\nThe final pathology demonstrated a 23 × 14.5 × 13.5 cm, 2590 grams, multiloculated, cystic mass (, ) consistent with ancient schwannoma characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells (), Antoni type A and type B () and strong positivity for S-100 protein (). The post-operative period was uneventful and patient was discharged home day 5 after surgery. At 11-month follow-up, the patient is free from recurrence."]

["The efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation for patients with chronic pouchitis: A case series: Patient 1 was a 24-year-old Japanese man. He was suffering from UC and had been diagnosed as fulminant type at the age of 20. RPC with IPAA was performed. He developed pouchitis 6 months after surgery and was treated with antibiotics. However, he later developed chronic antibiotics-resistant pouchitis with a relapsing and remitting pattern. Constantly, treatment with anti-TNF-α antibody (adalimumab) was started but the condition did not improve. The decision was then made to proceed with FMT for pouchitis, and this was performed following the screening of donors. The PDAI score before FMT was 9 points, and this decreased to 7 points at 8 weeks after transplantation. Neither a clinical remission nor a clinical response due to FMT was achieved. No adverse events were observed either after FMT or during the follow-up period (Table )."]

["Gastric remnant necrosis secondary to cholesterol crystal embolization after distal gastrectomy in a gastric cancer patient: a case report: A 70-year-old man presented with anorexia and dysphagia. His past medical history was notable for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis, and CCE. The CCE was triggered by a percutaneous coronary intervention in the context of myocardial infarction 7 years earlier. He had no history of smoking or alcohol abuse. Physical examination revealed cyanosis of both feet with dry gangrene of the distal toes but no livedo reticularis. The initial laboratory test results revealed a serum hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, total white cell count of 9850/μL with 5.9% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count, 581/μL; normal value < 500), serum carcinoembryonic antigen level of 3.2 ng/dL, and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 level of 15.3 ng/dL. Endoscopic examination revealed a type 4 tumor (Borrmann classification) circumferentially located, with invasion of the pyloric ring (Fig. ). Biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed focal circumferential wall thickening of the prepyloric antrum (T3) with several enlarged perigastric lymph nodes (N1) (Fig. ) without any evidence of metastasis (M0). He underwent distal gastrectomy with Billroth 2 reconstruction. The right and left gastroepiploic arteries and right and left gastric arteries were resected, but the splenic and short gastric arteries were preserved. Lymph node dissection D2 was also performed. Postoperative histopathological findings revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a TNM score of pT4aN0M0. Several cholesterol emboli were found within the gastric arterial walls (Fig. ).\\nOn postoperative day 11, the patient developed abdominal pain without fever. Laboratory data revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 17,190/μL) and an increased C-reactive protein level (21.13 mg/dL). Abdominal CT demonstrated a gastric wall discontinuity of the remnant stomach with fluid collection in the left subphrenic space. Gastric remnant necrosis was suspected, and an emergency laparotomy was performed.\\nLaparotomy revealed a necrotic gastric remnant. Most parts of the stomach, except for the greater curvature around the spleen, were completely necrosed (Fig. ). Total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction and abscess drainage were performed. The histopathological findings of the necrotic remnant showed total mucosal necrosis with cholesterol crystal emboli filling the arterioles (Fig. ). After surgery, anastomotic leakage occurred and was treated conservatively. However, he underwent emergency colostomy for perforation of the colon, which was due to the gastrointestinal involvement of CCE. CCE also aggravated his bilateral feet condition into amputation for gangrene. Although all of these deteriorations were treated, his superior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm suddenly ruptured and he expired."]
["Sinking Skin Flap Syndrome following Posttraumatic Hydrocephalus: A 55-year-old female patient who sustained head trauma in a Road Traffic Accident (RTA) and underwent left frontotemporoparietal decompression craniectomy was brought by relatives with deteriorated neurological status (GCS-9) after 2 months. Examination revealed a tense scalp skin flap at the craniectomy site and the patient was rushed to CT scan which revealed hydrocephalus. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VP shunt) on the right side was done in emergency setting and the patient gradually progressed to her preoperative neurological status and was discharged.\\nThe patient again presented 2 months later with right side spastic hemiparesis and severely sunken skin flap on the operated site. A diagnosis of SSFS was made and cranioplasty was planned. The patient was positioned in Trendelenburg position and rehydrated using NS and shunt was tied at the level of clavicle using silk 3-0 round bodied suture after making a C-loop of shunt so that it can be safely removed after cranioplasty. In 2 days, the flap was spontaneously significantly elevated and cranioplasty was performed with a flattened, artificial PMMA bone flap. Shunt occlusion was released immediately postoperatively and the patient gradually fully recovered her hemiparesis and was discharged on the 7th postoperative day ()."]
["Malignant sweat gland tumor of breast arising in pre-existing benign tumor: A case report: A 47-year-old female patient presented with a palpable lesion protruding from the left areola. This lesion was first noted 10 years earlier and had not shown changes. However, recently it noticeably increased in size.\\nShe underwent breast augmentation surgery with silicone implants eight years ago.\\nPhysical examination revealed a soft, fluctuating, mobile, and non-tender mass measuring approximately 4 cm in size. Part of the overlying skin was slightly greenish in appearance with mild protrusion. However, there was no ulcer or other skin changes.\\nSonography showed a well circumscribed oval cystic lesion with internal hyperechoic debris and fluid-fluid level. There was no internal blood flow on color doppler study. The mass broadly contacted with dermis, compressing the breast parenchyma (Figure ). Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to check breast implants, on which the lesion could also be evaluated. MRI showed a well circumscribed oval mass of left subareolar area measuring 3.9 cm. The lesion attached to the cutaneous layer of the areola and compressed the breast parenchyma. Thin fatty layer was noted between the mass and the breast parenchyma, suggesting separated mass from the breast. The lesion showed T1 hyper-intensity compared to muscle and high T2 signal intensity. On post-contrast fat saturation T1-weighted image, the mass showed a well-circumscribed thin and even enhancing wall. There was a small enhancing mural component in the inner wall of the mass (Figure ). It was not detected on ultrasound because internal debris filling the mass masked the mural component. In differentiation of the lesion, we overlooked the enhancing solid portion and considered the lesion as benign such as epidermal inclusion cyst.\\nThe tumor was resected due to its persistent and growing tendency. The mass was well demarcated with dense fibrous tissue. It was located between the breast parenchyma and the areola. The mass showed deep khaki color. It was filled with brownish and tan necrotic mucoid fluid. Microscopically, the lesion was predominantly cystic, measuring 3.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 2.4 cm with solid portion of 1 cm × 0.3 cm carcinoma and benign tissue of less than 0.1 cm. The carcinoma was composed of epithelial cells with clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli, and frequent mitosis. Suspicious microinvasion to the fibrous cystic wall was noted (Figure ). Resection margin was less than 1 mm and free of pathology. There was no lymphovascular invasion. Cytokeratin expression of the tumor showed positive for CK7 but negative for CK20. It was moderately positive for Ki-67, reflecting cell proliferation. Regarding other results in immunohistochemistry, it was positive for P63, C-erbB-2, and P53, but negative for estrogen and progesterone receptor."]
["17-Week Delay Surgery after Chemoradiation in Rectal Cancer with Complete Pathological Response: A 52-year-old man, with a 4-month history of bloody stool, change in size and shape of stools, and feeling of incomplete defecation, is subjected to a colonoscopy that revealed ulcer vegetative circumferential tumor at 6 cm of anal margin not crossable with colonoscope. Biopsy resulted in ulcerative adenocarcinoma ().\\nPhysical examination confirmed ulcerative circular lesion, fixed with lower edge at 6 cm of anal margin, without enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. CT scan (Figures , , and ) and MRI (Figures , , and ) revealed a large tumor with 9 cm of longitudinal length and 7 cm of transverse diameter that extended to left side of mesorectal fascia, multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes, and no evidence of inguinal nodal involvement or distant metastasis.\\nTumor staging was T4N+M0. Laboratory data showed a normal carcinoembryonic antigen serum level. Before initiating therapy, a laparoscopic colostomy was performed to avoid bowel obstruction. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was given: a total irradiation of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions and capecitabine 825 mg/m² (five weeks). CRT progressed uneventfully but, four weeks after the end of RT, the patient had an acute myocardial infarction requiring coronary stents and dual antiplatelet therapy. For this reason, surgery planned for 8 weeks after the end of RT was delayed. In the meantime, 11 weeks after RT completion a restaging MRI was performed. The size of rectal tumor had dramatically diminished, with tumor downstaging and increased mesorectal distance. Nonetheless, there were still some small nodular areas at the periphery of the posterior margin of the rectum that were suspicious for residual tumor (Figures , , and ).\\n17 weeks after radiotherapy the patient cardiac function recovered, and a radical surgical resection was performed. A conventional ultralow anterior rectal resection, with total mesorectum excision, was performed after colostomy closure by open access (Figures , , and ).\\nBowel transit reestablishment was carried out by a coloanal end-to-end anastomosis. A diverting ileostomy was placed in the previous colostomy site. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged from hospital 7 days after surgery. The resected specimen revealed mucin pools but no malignant epithelium, complete pathological response. In order to ensure the absence of epithelial cells within the mucin pools, the entire area containing macroscopic alteration was submitted to histopathological and immunohistochemistry analysis (Figures and ). The ileostomy closure was performed 6 weeks after rectal surgery."]
["Management of Pediatric Strokes With Alteplase (Tissue Plasminogen Activator): A 16-year-old female volleyball player presented to the emergency department with left facial weakness, slurred speech, horizontal nystagmus and left arm weakness. Her last known normal was 45 minutes prior to arrival. She was playing laser tag when she bumped heads with her friend in the course of the game followed by the onset of her symptoms. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were notified and the patient was transferred to the nearest comprehensive stroke center. The patient was not taking any prescribed medications and was not on oral contraceptives. She had no chronic medical conditions and denied regular use of any medication including oral contraceptives. On arrival, her blood pressure was 117/71 mmHg, blood glucose was 103 mg/dL and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 6 for left facial droop, dysarthria, expressive aphasia and left arm (3-/5) and left leg (4/5) weakness. In addition, she had un-sustained left gaze-evoked nystagmus, left skew deviation, but was able to follow commands. A stat CT of the head was normal (Figure ). Due to the uncertainty of a possible stroke, a stat MRI brain was obtained and showed a right thalamic infarct with a small penumbra on diffusion/perfusion imaging (Figure ). Telemedicine declined to see the pediatric patient. The adult neurologist on call was not credentialed to evaluate the pediatric case nor had the appropriate training. Further delay occurred in the process of trying to reach the nearest pediatric facility. When discussed with the pediatric hospital, they were hesitant on administering alteplase and ultimately recommended not to give alteplase. Subsequent deliberations took place among the onsite emergency room physician, on-call physician, stroke neurologist, and the Chief of Neurology. A consensus was reached after discussion with the patient’s parents to administer IV alteplase using our adult stroke protocol and lastly, a decision was made to transfer the patient to a pediatric facility. The door-to-needle time was 1 hour and 45 minutes. Alteplase administration was ultimately the correct decision with complete resolution of her symptoms. When the patient was transferred to a pediatric hospital after 24-hour alteplase protocol to monitor for hemorrhagic conversion, she was found to have a large patent foramen ovale. Repairing the congenital heart defect reduces the risk of subsequent stroke. The patient was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery and underwent corrective surgery."]
["Considerable Variability in the Efficacy of 8% Capsaicin Topical Patches in the Treatment of Chronic Pruritus in 3 Patients with Notalgia Paresthetica: A 49-year-old woman presented with itching and symmetrical bilateral hyperpigmentation below and medially to the scapulae (). She stated that the condition had emerged 5~6 years previously and reported 4~6 daily itch exacerbations, the itch intensity of which she rated at VAS=9. The patient also expressed concerns regarding the implications of the discoloration on her aesthetic appearance. The patient had undergone topical and systemic antifungal therapies in previous unsuccessful attempts to treat her pruritus. A biopsy revealed postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. The area of alloknesis slightly exceeded the area of hyperpigmentation.\\nAfter obtaining informed consent, the patient was treated with a topical 8% capsaicin patch for 1 hour. At follow-up, the patient reported that her itch had disappeared completely for 1 week, and thereafter very slowly receded toward baseline levels. Despite this slow reversal, the patient reported that, at the 3-month follow-up/retreatment, her average itch intensity remained lower compared to her pretreatment baseline levels of itch. At retreatment after 3 months, both the hyperpigmentation and the area of alloknesis had decreased considerably."]
["Malignant Skin Cancer Excision in Combined Therapy with Electro-Chemotherapy and Dermal Substitute: The patient was an 87-year-old female, affected by hand squamous cell carcinoma with invasion of deep structures including tendons. The patient had a positive history for recurrent sun burns on the hand dorsal zone. Patient showed at the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department at “Tor Vergata” University, two years after acute enhancement of papular lesions on the dorsal non-dominant hand. At the time of our clinical evaluation, the lesion was superficially ulcerated, appeared to be approximately 5 × 4 cm in size, and had infiltrated the deep tendons. Although limb amputation was recommended, the patient refused this surgical treatment. On this basis, a multidisciplinary team composed of plastic surgeons, a dermatologist and a hand surgeon evaluated the lesion’s extension and depth, and suggested two neoadjuvant intra-tumoral ECT procedures, at a distance of 3 months, with the aim of reducing the tumor size before a selective surgery, as alternative to the limb amputation. The substance loss reconstruction was performed in a one-step surgery with selective surgery using a CDT. Biopsy confirmed the clinical diagnosis of SCC. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed before the treatment, showing tumor invasion of deep and tendinous structures, and again after the procedures. The safety margins for complete eradication of the carcinoma were therefore represented by a partial amputation of the first, second and third distal and proximal phalanxes resulting in loss of the hand’s prehension capability."]
["Rare cytogenetic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia transformed from Fanconi anemia – a case report: A 17 year old male presented to the emergency with a history of high grade fever since two weeks. Examination revealed short stature, tapering jaw (Figure A), pallor and thumb polydactyly (Figure B). There was no visceromegaly or lymphadenopathy. Previous complete blood counts were not available. Family history was insignificant. Complete blood count showed haemoglobin 3.4 gm/dl, MCV 100 fl and MCH 36 pg, white blood cell count 55.9 × 10 E9/L and platelet 8 × 10E9/L. Peripheral blood smear revealed 26% blast cells (Figure A). Bone marrow was hypercellular exhibiting infiltration with 21% blast cells comprising of myeloblasts and monoblasts with presence of auer rods (Figure B). Bone trephine was hypercellular showing diffuse infiltration with sheets of blast cells. The overall findings were consistent with acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML M-4, according to F.A.B classification). The blasts cells expressed CD 33, CD13, HLA-DR, CD 117, CD34 antigens and cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase on immunophenotyping. Bone marrow cytogenetics revealed 46, XY, t (8:21) (q22; q22) [11]/ 46, XY, add (2) (q37),t (8; 21) [4]/46 XY [5] (Figure ). Mutation analysis for NPM 1 and FLT3 ITD was negative while FLT3 D835 was positive. Based on his physical findings, peripheral blood was sent for analysis of chromosomal breakage (Figure C). There were 1.98 average number of breaks/cell in patient’s cells while control sample had 0.05 average number of breaks/cell. Tri-radial and complex figures were also noted. These features were consistent with Fanconi anemia and the patient was presumed to be transformed into AML at presentation.\\nConsidering that the patient was high risk AML, option of subsequent allogeneic bone marrow transplant was discussed at consolidation therapy. Complete human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of the patient was performed and peripheral blood cytogenetics of his siblings was advised. He received induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine (3 + 7). During the hospital course, he developed febrile neutropenia for which he was empirically treated with antibiotics. Blood and urine cultures did not reveal growth of organisms. The neutropenia resolved on Day 21 and the patient became afebrile. Day 14 bone marrow revealed clearance of blast cells while minimal residual disease showed 0.03% blast cells. He was discharged and was advised follow up in outpatient clinic. However the patient was lost to follow up."]
["Acute radiation syndrome in a non-destructive testing worker: a case report: Thirty-one-year-old male.\\nAnorexia, general weakness, prostration, and mild dizziness for several days.\\nNo specific findings.\\nCurrent smoker (15 pack-years) and social drinker.\\nThe patient had worked for 5 years in Yeosu National Industrial Complex as a non-destructive testing worker and had no job before. He performed radiographic testing using gamma radiation. In January 2017, the Korea Information System on Occupational Exposure (KISOE) found that his personal thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) badge indicated that he had exceeded the exposure limit. The patient’s TLD badge indicated that in December 2016, the patient’s radiation exposure dose for the month was 120 mSv. The patient’s radiation exposure dose was 1191 mSv according to the chromosome aberration test by South Korea’s Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSCC) []. The patient visited our hospital via the emergency room, and underwent a complete blood count test and bone marrow biopsy. It was revealed that the patient performed non-destructive tests without radiation shielding when working in high places of the large pipe surface.\\nWhen the patient came to our hospital, he was clearly conscious with a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, temperature of 37.5 °C, pulse rate of 104 beats/min, and respiration rate of 20 breaths/min. He was anemic. The venous injection areas had bruises and bleeding tendency. There were no abnormal findings in the cornea and lens of the eye. We tried to perform semen analysis but failed due to the patient’s condition. Subsequently, semen analysis could not be performed because of refusal by the patient.\\nIn a pre-placement medical examination conducted 6 months before the accident, all blood parameters were in the normal range: white blood cell count: 4920 cells/mm3, absolute neutrophil count: 2410 cells/mm3, absolute lymphocyte count: 1880 cells/mm3, hemoglobin: 14.7 g/dL, and platelet: 217 × 103/mm3. A blood test performed in the hospital after the symptoms appeared showed severe pancytopenia: white blood cell count: 1360 cells/mm3, absolute neutrophil count: 500 cells/mm3, absolute lymphocyte count: 680 cells/mm3, hemoglobin: 7.1 g/dL, and platelet: 14 × 103/mm3. The laboratory results showed a slight recovery after 26 days from the date of prohibition of work: white blood cell count: 2200 cells/mm3, absolute neutrophil count: 760 cells/mm3, absolute lymphocyte count: 1080 cells/mm3. After a 13-month follow-up on the blood test, pancytopenia improved over time; however, it did not recover to the level before the accident (Table , Fig. ).\\nThe patient’s radiation exposure dose was assessed using lymphocyte depletion kinetics. The patient’s lowest absolute lymphocyte count was 0.65 × 109 cells/L, and the radiation exposure dose based on this count was 1.4 Gy (95% confidence limits: 1.1–1.6) [, ]. The patient’s radiation exposure dose was 1191 mSv in the chromosome aberration test by South Korea’s NSCC []."]
["Ocular Injury Caused by the Sprayed Venom of the Asian Giant Hornet (Vespa mandarinia): A 77-year-old man, a bee feeder, was injured in his right eye by the sprayed venom of the Asian giant hornet (V. mandarinia; Fig. ) in early October. His right eye was washed with physiological saline as a first aid treatment on the same day and treated with steroid and antibiotic eye drops by the nearest ophthalmologist; however, the corneal epithelial defect persisted, lenticular opacity increased, and pupil dilation occurred as the atrophy of the iris progressed. He was referred to the Cornea Service of Fujita Health University Bantane Hospital in late November of the same year for further management and treatment.\\nOn initial examination, his best corrected visual acuity (decimal) was hand movement (uncorrectable) for the right eye and 0.7 (with 1.2 × +1.5 D) for the left eye. The intraocular pressure of the right eye could not be measured, whereas that of the left eye was 12 mm Hg. Epithelial edema with an epithelial defect of 8 × 4 mm was observed on the right cornea. The thickened cornea and the presence of folds of Descemet's membrane with pigmentary keratic precipitates suggested corneal endothelial decompensation (Fig. ). The iris of the right eye was depigmented and irregularly dilated. The fundus of the right eye could not be examined because of the hazy cornea and the presence of mature cataract.\\nDetectable electroretinogram (ERG) waveforms recorded 3 months after the first visit, when the corneal epithelial defect had healed, suggested that the residual retinal function had some potential for visual improvement after cataract surgery. However, the amplitude was decreased (60.50 μV for the right eye and 364.00 μV for the left eye) and the implicit time was delayed (19.50 ms for the right eye and 12.25 ms for the left eye) in the a-wave (Fig. ). Since the corneal edema with epithelial bulla remained after phacoemulsification and aspiration and intraocular lens implantation, corneal endothelial transplantation (Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty [DSAEK]) was performed on the right eye about 1 year after the injury.\\nAfter DSAEK, the cornea of the right eye became clearer, even though the stromal edema remained (Fig. ). His vision got better subjectively, but the visual acuity of his right eye did not improve. The ERG results recorded after phacoemulsification and aspiration and intraocular lens implantation plus DSAEK (Fig. ) showed an increased amplitude and faster implicit time of the a-wave compared with that recorded before the surgery; however, the a-wave amplitude after the surgery was almost half of that of the fellow eye. Fundus examination revealed branch retinal artery occlusion (Fig. ), but optic disc atrophy was not observed.\\nThe apparent corneal edema in the right eye began 7 months after DSAEK, and the cornea became hazy with signs of neovascularization 1 year after DSAEK. Since no significant improvement in visual acuity was recorded after DSAEK, probably due to the damage in retinal function, we decided not to perform a second DSAEK."]
["Novel Compound Heterozygous Mutations in CTSC Gene in a Chinese Family with Papillon-Lefevre Syndrome: A 2-year-old boy, the younger brother of the first patient, was also referred to our institution for the similar symptoms as his brother (). Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis started at the age of 3 months. At the present stage, the boy had no obvious periodontal problems or loss of deciduous teeth. His medical history showed he had no serious infectious disease; his unaffected parents were not intermarriage."]
["Inverted and Impacted Maxillary and Mandibular Third Molar: Unusual Case Reports with Review of the Literature: A 45-year-old male patient reported to the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, with the chief complaint of multiple decayed teeth. Clinical intraoral examination revealed dental caries in 17, fractured restoration in 26, root stump of 27, and deep dental caries in 36. Clinically 36, 37 were absent due to extraction a few years before because of pulpal involvement of the teeth. Orthopantomogram (OPG) confirmed the oral findings. The OPG also showed an impacted 18 and inverted 28 impaction. As shown in , the crown of the impacted molar was facing the maxillary sinus floor. The patient was informed, but he refused to have surgery to remove the impacted teeth. He was only interested in having the decayed teeth treated. The patient was, therefore, advised to report for periodic follow-up visits."]
["The 10th Korea-Japan Joint Meeting for Vascular Surgery: 46-year-old woman complained of her right foot ulcer. She had diagnosed Buerger disease and had undertook finger and toe amputations before. Leg angiography revealed popliteal artery occlusion. After failed angioplasty at previous hospital we performed bypass surgery from above knee to below knee popliteal artery using autologous saphenous vein. After the operation, the wound was healed. Although she needed balloon angioplasty once, she has been well and graft has been patent for 2 years."]
["Endometrial Stromal Hyperplasia: An Underrecognized Condition: A 75-year-old woman presented with a one-week history of heavy abnormal vaginal bleeding. She had two normal deliveries. The patient was obese, hypertensive and had a 10 mm thick endometrium with two small polyps protruding into the endometrial cavity. She was currently taking thyroxin for hypothyroidism; she was not receiving hormonal therapy. Diagnostic and therapeutic curettage yielded four endometrial fragments composed entirely of small, regular stromal cells with ovoid to spindle-shaped nuclei and an ill-defined cytoplasm, reminiscent of normal late proliferative stroma. There were no cellular pleomorphism, mitotic activity, or invasion of lymph-vascular channels. The cells were arranged in sheets in which many vessels of the arteriolar cell type were present (). Of the two polyps received, one contained proliferative-type glands in a fibrotic stroma; the other was formed exclusively of stromal cells with features similar to those described in the endometrium. The biopsy was reported as “endometrial stromal lesion “stromal hyperplasia” endometrial stromal nodule.” A subsequent ultrasound was normal. The patient was alive and well at 14 months. On the basis of clinical and histological features, sonographic imaging, and follow-up information, this case was considered to be an endometrial stromal hyperplasia.\\nImmunohistochemistry was performed in all cases and revealed a diffuse positivity for ER (), PR, vimentin and bcl-2, and focal positivity for CD10. They were negative for α-smooth muscle actin, calretinin."]
["Metaplastic breast carcinoma with extensive osseous differentiation: A 43-year-old female presented with a firm, non-tender lump in the right breast, which progressed to present size over a period of two months. The mammogram revealed a well-circumscribed, high-density lesion with popcorn-like calcification. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) demonstrated a heterogeneously enhancing mass lesion of size 3.2 x 3 x 2.9cm with central necrotic area in upper inner quadrant of the right breast with chunky calcification within the lesion. A clinical diagnosis of Phyllodes tumor was considered.\\nBiopsy from the lesion revealed a tumor constituting bizarre, pleomorphic cells with atypical nuclei, numerous tumor giant cells, along with osteoid-like material. A diagnosis of malignant neoplasm with osteoblastic differentiation with differential diagnosis of malignant phyllodes with osteoblastic differentiation and metaplastic carcinoma was given.\\nThe patient underwent wide local excision of the lump. The gross appearance of the tumor revealed a multiloculated solid-cystic mass filled with blood ().\\nFrozen section examination revealed a tumor with multiple vascular spaces surrounded by pleomorphic cells and osteoid production evidence. A diagnosis of malignant vascular lesion vs. malignant phyllodes was suggested on cryosection.\\nRoutine microscopic examination revealed an invasive biphasic tumor comprising malignant epithelial and stromal components. The epithelial component was ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) with high nuclear grade arranged in cribriform and comedonecrosis pattern. Focal apocrine change was noted. The malignant stromal component comprised of vague fascicles of spindle-shaped cells exhibiting marked nuclear pleomorphism, atypia, vesicular nuclei, and 1-2 conspicuous nucleoli. Mitosis of 13/10HPF along with many atypical mitotic figures was noted. Many bizarre, multinucleated and osteoclastic giant cells were noted along with extensive osseous differentiation. Large cystic areas were identified, which were lined by atypical pleomorphic cells filled with hemorrhage. Many bony trabeculae were identified with surrounding osteoblastic rimming ( and ).\\nMany proliferating blood vessels were noted interspersed in between the atypical pleomorphic cells highlighted by the CD31 immunohistochemical marker. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated a strong diffuse membranous and cytoplasmic positivity for Cytokeratin (CK) in the DCIS component. p63 was positive in the mesenchymal component and focally positive in the DCIS component. Ki-67 proliferation index was around 8-10%, and the tumor cells were triple-negative for ER, PR, and Her2neu. CD31 was negative in the tumor cells ().\\nThe postoperative period of the patient was uneventful. The patient received four cycles of Adriamycin and Cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy. No recurrence occurred during the 6-month follow-up period."]
["Planning TTFields treatment using the NovoTAL system-clinical case series beyond the use of MRI contrast enhancement: A 65-year-old man initially presented with word processing difficulties. MRI of the brain revealed a heterogeneously enhancing left temporo-occipital mass. He underwent an awake craniotomy with subtotal resection. Pathology was consistent with GBM, IDH1 wild-type, MGMT unmethylated. He was treated with conventional chemo-RT. His postradiation MRI showed disease progression and bevacizumab was initiated, resulting in a radiographic improvement. After 5 months of treatment, his MRI demonstrated progression of the nonenhancing tumor and the patient declined clinically. At progression, he was started on dexamethasone, temozolomide, and TTFields. NovoTAL mapping was performed targeting the new nonenhancing FLAIR abnormality (Fig. )."]
["Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy in an unknown primary cancer: We present an autopsy case of a 47-year-old male patient who developed acute breathlessness and died suddenly. At autopsy there was mild right ventricular dilatation and lungs showed few firm areas and prominent bronchovasculature. No mass lesion was noted anywhere. On microscopy, the lungs showed the presence of florid fibrocellular intimal proliferation of the arterioles and small arteries []. Vessels showed fibrin thrombi and occasional vessel showed tumor emboli composed of neoplastic adenocarcinoma cells showing glandular and occasional signet ring morphology. There was evidence of lymphangiosis carcinomatosis []. There were similar tumor emboli in the myocardium, peripancreatic tissue, and perigastric lymph nodes []. Despite extensive sectioning no primary tumor was found. The immunohistochemistry results showed positivity for pan keratin indicating an epithelial tumor. Tumor cells were negative for CK 7, CK10, TTF 1, and PSA. The final cause of death was given as acute cor pulmonale following pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy in an unknown primary adenocarcinoma."]
["Palatal peripheral ossifying fibroma: A rare occurrence: A 68-year-old female presented to our outpatient department with the chief complaint of soft tissue growth on her left palate. History revealed that the growth had appeared 4 months prior as a small nodule and had gradually increased to its present size. Her medical and personal histories were insignificant. Clinical intraoral examination revealed a shiny, oval pink swelling on the left side of palate in relation to the cementoenamel junction of 26. It extended from 23 to 27 anteroposteriorly and was 1 cm lateral to palatal midline to the occlusal surface of the left maxillary molars buccolingually. The growth was smooth, firm to rubbery in consistency, non-fluctuant, pedunculated, non-tender, with no temperature change over the growth, and not associated with discharge []. The lesion was about 3.5 cm mesiodistally and 2.5 cm buccopalatally and did not interfere with occlusion. Grossly, it appeared as an exophytic mass on the hard palate that had apparently originated outside of bone. 26 was Grade I mobile and 28 was carious, but non-tender on percussion.\\nThe patient was subjected to radiographic examination and her computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a well-defined radiopaque lesion about 3 cm × 3 cm × 2 cm on the left side of the palate which was attached to the underlying palatal tissue in region of 26, with a distinct plane of cleavage [].\\nAfter routine blood examinations, excisional biopsy of the lesion was done under antibiotic coverage and local anesthesia after obtaining written informed consent. The lesion was isolated and dissected from its stalk on the palatal mucosa of 26 and removed in toto []. The excised specimen measured about 4 cm × 4 cm × 2 cm with glistening smooth pink surfaces all around, except the resected base of the lesion which was severed and red []. The surgical site on the palate was allowed to heal by secondary intention [] and a surgical splint was provided, to facilitate this. Extraction of 28 was done with thorough curettage of the adjacent periodontal ligament (PDL) and periosteum to prevent recurrence. Histological examination revealed epithelium overlying a richly cellular fibroblastic connective tissue stroma comprising bony trabeculae with osteoblastic rimming of mature bone with a predominantly lamellar structure [], confirming the lesion as POF. On regular follow-up, the lesion healed uneventfully with no complications."]

The UGSPB was performed as previously described with 1 ml/kg of 0.25% levobupivacaine."]
["Tuberculosis of the Thyroid in a Child: A Rare cause of Thyromegaly: A 6-year-old female child presented with midline neck swelling for the past two months. She also had low-grade intermittent fever. There was no history of associated difficulty in swallowing or breathing. No features suggestive of hypo- or hyper-thyroidism were present. On local examination, there was multinodular thyroid swelling. The nodules were variable in size, largest being 2 cm x 2 cm. The nodules were soft to firm in consistency and slightly tender. The swelling moved up with deglutition. There was no fixity to the overlying skin or underlying structures. Laboratory investigations, including thyroid function tests, were within reference range.\\nOn ultrasonography (USG), thyroid gland was diffusely enlarged with altered echotexture. Multiple ill-defined and few well defined nodules were seen in both lobes. Largest nodule in right lobe measured 11mm x 8 mm and that in the left lobe measured 15 mm x 3mm. A radiological impression of multinodular goiter was made. On fine needle aspiration yellowish material was obtained. Giemsa-stained smears showed large areas of caseous necrosis with few epithelioid cell granulomas and foamy histiocytes (Fig. 1a and b). Scattered clusters of benign follicular cells were also seen (Fig. 1c). Ziehl-Neelsen stain revealed occasional acid-fast bacilli (Fig. 1d). A final cytological diagnosis of tuberculous thyroiditis was made.\\nThe child was investigated further with Mantoux test, chest roentgenogram and abdominal USG. All were reported as within normal range. Anti-tuberculous therapy with four drugs for three months followed by consolidation phase of three drugs for six months was advised. A follow-up examination at six months showed significant reduction in the size of swelling."]
["Recurrent chikungunya retinitis: A 26-year-old white British woman travelled to Mexico in August 2015 and developed chikungunya infection while touring a jungle area. The infection was confirmed by a local doctor, as the patient had the classic chikungunya symptoms of fever, joint pain and skin eruption. On returning to the UK, the patient consulted a rheumatologist for having persistent joint pains. Chikungunya infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in November 2015. All other possible rheumatological diseases were excluded by further tests. Chest X-ray, Anticnuclear antibody (ANA), anti nuclear cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) rheumatoid factor, full blood count and C reactive protein were normal.\\nIn July 2016, the patient presented to the urgent care department in ophthalmology with gradual loss of vision in her left eye for the past 1 week. Her Snellen visual acuity was 6/6, right eye, and 6/12, left eye. Ocular examination of the right eye was normal. In the left eye, anterior segment examination and intraocular pressure by Goldmann applanation tonometry were normal. There was no afferent pupillary defect. Posterior segment examination revealed an inflammatory foveal lesion (). High-definition Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan of the left eye showed increased reflectivity of the neurosensory retina with a cleft of underlying subretinal fluid (). Angio-OCT scan showed areas of capillary dropout on the nasal aspect of the foveal avascular zone (). Fluorescein angiography () showed an area of leakage in the fovea suggesting focal foveal capillary vasculitis, whereas indocyanine green (ICG) angiography () failed to show active choroidal inflammation.\\nThe patient was not on any medication, and there was no ocular history of relevance."]
