It is common after hysterectomy and can affect quality of life by causing pressure and discomfort, and by its effect on urinary, bowel and sexual function.\nTreatment is rarely indicated if there are no symptoms. Mild-to-moderate prolapse may be treated with conservative measures such as pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation and biofeedback. Topical oestrogens and mechanical measures such as pessaries may also be used. Surgery may be needed when the prolapse is severe. Different surgical procedures are available using vaginal or abdominal (open, laparoscopic or robotic) approaches. Some procedures involve the use of mesh, with the aim of providing additional support."]
[" The results also showed higher rates of Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses at 3 months with tofacitinib compared with placebo in both trials. Also, a statistically significantly higher proportion of people having tofacitinib also saw improvements in their ability to do daily activities compared with placebo, as assessed by the health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ‑DI). The committee was aware that there was limited evidence on radiographic progression for tofacitinib. However, the clinical experts stated that the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis gave an indication of disease progression, and that if treatment was able to control symptoms they would expect to see a delay in the progression of joint destruction. The clinical experts also commented that there were good data available for tofacitinib's effect on progression in people with rheumatoid arthritis. The committee recognised that the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis were the main outcomes relevant to the cost-effectiveness analysis. It concluded that tofacitinib improved joint and skin symptoms compared with placebo.\n\n## The OPAL trials are generalisable to NHS clinical practice\nThe ERG considered that the OPAL trials were well conducted, and that the study design was similar to trials of other NICE recommended treatments for psoriatic arthritis."]

[" The company used data from the Rory Morrison Registry to estimate that, in the absence of ibrutinib, 49% of people would have BR and 51% would have DRC. The clinical experts agreed that it was reasonable to estimate that about 50% of people would have each treatment. This was because, typically, people would initially have treatment with either BR or DRC, and their second-line treatment would be whichever they had not had first line (BR followed by DRC, or DRC followed by BR). The company also presented scenarios to account for variation in clinical practice across the UK, with use of BR and DRC varying between 40% and 60%. The committee recalled that the data for BR had been from people whose condition was relapsed or refractory and who had had previous treatment. It also recalled that the data for DRC had been from people who had not had previous chemoimmunotherapy. This meant that the comparison with BR was more applicable to how zanubrutinib would be used within its marketing authorisation (that is after 1 or more treatments). It also meant that it was more robust than the comparison with DRC. The committee noted that there was methodological difficulty with the blended comparator. This was because it relied on an assumption of the proportions of people who would have BR or DRC in clinical practice. It also included the comparison with DRC, which was the more uncertain. The committee concluded that it would take into account the cost-effectiveness results for both the blended and the pairwise comparisons."]

["\nOrganizational culture may be the most important asset driving department performance. Academic radiology departments are large enough that culture may vary across the organization, but it is important to have an overall approach to department culture. Schein (11) provides a framework with which to think about organizational culture in layers: organization values, behavioral norms, and tangible artifacts (rituals, physical workspace arrangement, and language). An established and healthy organizational culture can foster an organized, unified, and coherent response to a crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Leadership must be intentional in developing and maintaining organizational culture. Three major leadership activities establish and promote organizational culture: message, model, and manage. Both internal and external department communications should include organizational vision and expected behavioral norms. Leadership should model expected behavioral norms. Finally, the workforce development program should include aspects of organizational culture, including yearly reviews, incentive plans, and recruitment. It is particularly important to recruit for cultural fit, which may be prioritized over technical skill. Clear external communication of a positive and inclusive culture will attract trainee, faculty, and staff applicants who resonate with the department culture, facilitating recruitment of individuals who will contribute to the established culture."]

[" This is dependent on clearance or washout of thallium-201 from the myocardium, which no longer depends on blood flow but rather on the concentration gradient between myocytes and blood levels. Redistribution of thallium-201 is quicker in normal myocardium than in ischemic myocardium, resulting in different activities in these tissues (differential \"washout\"). Due to the characteristics described and the ability to evaluate the integrity of the cellular membrane, thallium-201 has the additional property of studying myocardial viability, predominantly related to hibernating myocardium .This represents the condition of resting left ventricular dysfunction, resulting from chronic hypoperfusion in myocardial regions where, although the myocytes have remained viable (alive), they have chronically depressed contractile function. Hibernation may also be seen as a \"flow-contraction\" agreement process, where metabolism remains dependent on residual myocardial flow in a manner sufficient for minimum substrate supply and inhibitory substance removal. Therefore, the condition of hibernation, notwithstanding reduced resting coronary flow, is not necessarily associated with the presence of chronic ischemia, given that oxygen supply and consumption ratio may be preserved."]

It stated that, for the cost per QALY gained to be equal to £20,000 per QALY gained, an additional 0.037 QALYs would be needed, a value greater than the value of 0.02 discounted QALYs assumed in the sensitivity analyses. The Assessment Group stated that it was unlikely that the ICER for high-viscosity cement compared with low-viscosity cement would be lower than £20,000 per QALY gained. However, the Assessment Group stated that a patient might need another operation if there was a problem with low-viscosity cement. So the Assessment Group estimated that, if more than 25% of patients needed another procedure on the same vertebra, then a strategy of using high-viscosity cement in all patients for the first procedure would be more cost effective."]

[" Moreover, for the Dutch situation, the role of the healthcare professions involved was described per objective in diagnosis and treatment. It should be noted that the present recommendations are aimed at managing RA-related foot problems in the Netherlands. Since the content, (expertise of ) involved disciplines, and organisation of RA-related footcare may vary per country, this may hamper the generalizability of the frameworks and recommendations to other countries. The level of evidence of the developed recommendations varies from 1 (highest) to 4 (lowest). Overall, most of the developed recommendations were based on expert opinion, as there is a lack of research evidence. Only a few number of the topics addressed in the recommendations were subject of investigation in previously published high-quality research. Evidence, based on randomised controlled trials' (\"RCT\") between-group differences, was found for the application of corticosteroid injections (in finger joints, based on a single RCT), foot orthoses (for treatment of pain and high forefoot pressure, based on multiple RCTs), ready-made therapeutic shoes (for treatment of high plantar pressure, based on a single RCT), patient education (not foot specific), and exercise therapy (not foot specific).

[" The Committee acknowledged the ERG's view that based on a visual analysis, a 2-phase exponential model was a better fit to the trial data and therefore more accurately represented survival for patients treated with afatinib compared with pemetrexed plus cisplatin over the long term. The Committee therefore concluded that the underlying methodology of the mixed treatment comparison was not sufficiently robust.\nThe Committee also noted that the manufacturer's original mixed treatment model included trials of patients with mixed or unknown EGFR mutation status as well as patients with EGFR mutation-positive disease. It acknowledged that this had been necessary to enable the manufacturer to join the network in the mixed treatment comparison to ensure all the tyrosine kinase inhibitors could be compared. However, the Committee noted the ERG comment that differences in patient characteristics between studies of patients of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and those of unknown or mixed EGFR mutation status (for example, in relation to the proportion of men, those who have never smoked and patients with adenocarcinoma) meant that the populations of the included trials were not sufficiently similar to be included in a mixed treatment comparison."]

["\n\n# Patient health behaviour modi cation\nIn the case of severe obesity (class 3 or class 2 plus comorbid conditions) with insufficient weight loss despite behavioural or pharmacologic treatment, bariatric surgery might be considered when there is an acceptable operative risk. Bariatric surgery has been shown to lower all-cause mortality by 24% to 40%, improve quality of life, and reverse abnormal glucose metabolism including diabetes, but late complications might arise from nutritional defi ciencies and behavioural changes. 16 The Study of Health Assessment and Risk in Ethnic Groups highlights the point that fi ndings from studies carried out in European populations cannot always be extrapolated to other ethnocultural populations. 17 For instance, South Asian and Chinese populations demonstrate increased CMR at body mass index or waist circumference levels traditionally considered to be \"normal\"; accordingly, ethnic-specifi c thresholds should be applied to these subpopulations. White Canadians have a lower incidence of hypertension and lower LDL-C levels than Canadian South Asians and lower rates of obesity and smoking relative to Canadian aboriginals. Furthermore, black Canadians have a higher prevalence of hypertension and present at an earlier age. Taken together, the evidence to date supports the importance of integrating a patient's ethnicity and culture into the assessment and management of CMR.\nElevated CMR is a key driver of cardiovascular events."]

The Committee then discussed the sensitivity analyses for management in children and noted that, when the analysis was based on Pijnenburg et al., a more favourable ICER of £19,000 per QALY gained was obtained. It also noted that, when it was assumed that FeNO measurement impacts for a shorter length of time on exacerbations and inhaled corticosteroid use, FeNO measurement plus management as recommended in the British guideline on the management of asthma (2012), hereafter referred to as the 'British guideline', dominated management by the British guideline use alone for up to 4 years.

["\n\n## Extrapolating survival\nThe company and the EAG used different extrapolation curves for estimating survival after early metastatic recurrence. The company used an exponential distribution and the EAG used the Gompertz distribution. The EAG argued that using an exponential distribution is unsuitable when the data violates the proportional hazards assumption. It highlighted that the company had presented evidence that hazards between arms were non-proportional. Both Kaplan–Meier curves and log-cumulative hazards indicated violation of proportional hazards. The EAG thought that the Gompertz distribution gave the most plausible survival difference between arms and, given the long-term uncertainty, was more conservative. The clinical experts noted that the latest publication of the OlympiA data showed that the proportional hazards assumption was met for survival. The committee noted that the choice of extrapolation method had a small effect on the ICER, so did not discuss this further.\n\n## Company's utility values\nThe utility values used in the modelling were a key driver of the cost-effectiveness results, particularly the values for the disease-free health state.

["\nApplication of the health check concept to Asian practice An important part of the global change in vaccination practice has been the move towards delivering vaccination as one part of an annual health check and promoting to clients that their annual veterinary visit is for a holistic assessment of the animal's health and wellbeing, rather than simply to receive a vaccine booster. The annual health check concept is rapidly gaining popularity in many countries of the world, where it has been proven to be advantageous for the business of veterinary practice. There is no reason why this concept should not be equally well received by the affluent urban clients of Asian veterinary practitioners and the VGG would encourage the national associations to provide education in, and endorsement for, the concept. Even in a less affluent rural community, the small animal practitioner should consider aspects of nutrition and ecto-and endoparasite control at the same time as deciding on a vaccination protocol for the individual pet animal. In some parts of Asia, it has been observed that a high proportion of pups and kittens carry high parasitic burdens and that it would be a sensible approach to deal with these before vaccination, in order to achieve the greatest possible protective immune response following administration of a vaccine."]

[" It is characterised by airflow obstruction and increased responsiveness of the airways to various stimuli. Symptoms include recurring episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing. Typical asthma symptoms tend to be variable, intermittent and worse at night. Asthma is commonly triggered by viral respiratory infections, exercise, smoke, cold, and allergens such as pollen, mould, animal fur and the house dust mite.\nIt is estimated that there are 5.2 million people with asthma in the UK, of whom approximately 2.9 million are women and girls and 2.3 million are men and boys.

The patient expert said young people of school or university age may also experience clots and INR monitoring can lead to disruption of education. The patient expert further explained that the burdens of monitoring and dose adjustments with warfarin may also affect carers of people who have had a pulmonary embolus and they may have to make adjustments to their own schedules to enable the person for whom they are caring to monitor their INR. As warfarin has many drug interactions, it may be unsuitable for people with comorbidities, and because of various food interactions, people may need to adjust and monitor their diet and lifestyle. The patient expert said that there are some people whose INR is unstable on warfarin or who are allergic to it, for whom an alternative is needed. The patient expert highlighted that rivaroxaban can be used at the onset of pulmonary embolism in primary or secondary care. Rivaroxaban has the advantage that it avoids injections, regular blood tests and the diet and lifestyle considerations necessary with the combination of heparin and warfarin.

Patients with untreated or refractory CNS disease or with circulating blasts are not eligible for transplantation.\n- Patients should receive at least one cycle of post-remission therapy prior to transplantation if transplantation cannot occur within 4 weeks of the complete remission being achieved.\nRisk stratification in AML has traditionally relied on patient and disease characteristics at diagnosis (chiefly: age, cytogenetics, white blood cell count at diagnosis and the presence of an antecedent hematological disorder or therapy related disease) and on the response to induction chemotherapy. While patients in favorable risk categories may enjoy long-term disease free survival, AML may be virtually incurable with conventional treatment in patients with high-risk features and those with poor response to chemotherapy.

[" A similar effect was observed in OCTAVE Sustain for both dosages of tofacitinib (5 mg and 10 mg), with the difference in comparison with placebo being greater for tofacitinib 10 mg at the end of the maintenance phase (week 52). The subgroup results for prior TNF-alpha inhibitor exposure status, which were used by the company in their economic modelling, show a similar effect. The ERG explained that the OCTAVE trials were not powered to test the statistical significance of subgroup analyses so the results should be interpreted with caution.

The Committee heard from the clinical expert that vortioxetine would not be used first line, but was likely to be used second line or third line for treating a major depressive episode. The clinical expert explained that this was because vortioxetine's tolerability and efficacy are comparable with other antidepressants categorised in NICE's guideline on depression in adults as 'better‑tolerated newer generation antidepressants'. The clinical expert expressed the view that vortioxetine was more likely to be prescribed in secondary than primary care because its price is higher than other antidepressants.

["\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n## Diagnosis of and screening for nafld\nFor the diagnosis of NAFLD, it is important to exclude other causes of liver disease and to examine the liver for fatty changes. Therefore, in cases that are clinically suspicious for chronic liver diseases or that have abnormal findings on liver function tests, medical history taking and serological testing must be performed to exclude critical causes of chronic liver disease in Korea, such as chronic hepatitis virus B or C infection, alcoholic liver diseases, drug-induced liver diseases, autoimmune liver diseases, and Wilson's disease. In addition, abdominal ultrasonography can be performed to assess the liver for steatosis. In cases of a lack of abnormal findings on liver function tests, which patients should be candidates for NAFLD screening? There is currently no consensus on the answer to this question. Insulin resistance is known to be a critical risk factor for the incidence of NAFLD. However, performing a screening test remains controversial for identifying the presence of NAFLD in patients with metabolic syndrome, in whom insulin resistance plays a crucial role in NAFLD pathogenesis. The 2009 Special Conference of the European Association for the Study of the Liver recommended blood tests and abdominal ultrasonography for NAFLD in patients who present with insulin resistance and related diseases, because they are likely to have NASH."]

[" The committee noted that clinical expert opinions drew little on experience of the rare RET fusion-positive form of NSCLC. It also noted that there is little long-term experience of using selpercatinib in the NHS. The ERG said that selection based on clinical advice rather than statistical tests, was open to bias. The direction and magnitude of any bias was not clear from the data. The ERG did not select a preferred alternative base-case extrapolation function because it thought the data and NMAs were too uncertain to make this possible. It noted that the Gompertz alternative extrapolation would match the clinical evidence most closely, and would be just as appropriate a selection of extrapolation as Spline/Knot1. However, it noted that it resulted in substantially different cost-effectiveness results. A different approach was used for PFS with selpercatinib, in that the stratified Gompertz distribution was used to fit the data. The committee discussed the differences in the extrapolated OS estimations presented and that this was, in part, caused by the short follow up of the LIBRETTO‑001 trial. The ERG said that, based on its inspection of extrapolations fit to the LIBRETTO‑001 data, OS for selpercatinib appeared to have been overestimated by the company. The clinical expert and Cancer Drugs Fund clinical lead supported this view. The committee acknowledged the uncertainty in PFS and OS estimates, particularly in the wide range of extrapolations for selpercatinib."]

Evidence from studies in people without cancer may not be applicable because cancer could affect the action of these drugs.

[" As the inherent baseline risk of cancer is approximately 1 in 3, this is a very small relative increase, and is likely outweighed by the potential benefits of preventing CRC in patients who have been identified as high-risk (by virtue of their need for colonic surveillance). The risk must also be weighed against the alternative-that is, adverse incidents arising from repeated colonoscopic surveillance. Since radiation risks are greater in younger patients, in whom endoscopic perforation risks are smaller, and vice versa for older patients, the risk:benefit equation will vary according to patient factors including age, intensity of the surveillance programme and comorbidity.\nTherefore, the radiation risk of cancer induction from CTC is very small and the risks are significantly outweighed by detection of cancer when colonic surveillance with CTC is indicated.\nWe do not recommend the use of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) for surveillance after resection of premalignant colorectal polyps, as there is insufficient evidence.\n\n## Grade of evidence: low strength of recommendation: strong\nSeveral studies report on the long-term performance of FIT-based population screening programmes for CRC, but evidence for surveillance after polypectomy is lacking in these studies.

The trials addressing whether a long-term antiplatelet agent is needed in patients that have stents and require a DOAC, which suggest a DOAC alone may be safe, are not sufficiently powered to look at the important endpoint of stent thrombosis. Many consultant interventional cardiologists in the UK recommend their patients remain on a single antiplatelet agent if they have stents and need a long term DOAC, although this will very much vary on an individual case-by-case basis. Therefore, in patients with coronary stents who are taking a DOAC the cessation of the single antiplatelet agent should always be discussed in advance with the consultant interventional cardiologist responsible for the patient's care.\nFollowing the publication of three RCTs in 2018 the use of aspirin in primary prevention in cardiovascular disease is no longer routinely recommended and should only be considered, on a case-by-case basis, in those with a very high individual risk of cardiovascular events. 13\n\n## P2y12 receptor antagonists\nAntiplatelet drugs have a rapid onset of action, and irreversibly inhibit platelet activity.
